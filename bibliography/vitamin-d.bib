abstract = {{1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), the active form of vitamin D, is known to regulate calcium and phosphorus metabolism, thus being a key-player in bone-formation. However 1,25(OH)2D3 also has a physiological role beyond its well-known role in skeletal homeostasis. Here, we describe 1,25(OH)2D3 as an immunomodulator targeting various immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), as well as T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes, hence modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses. Besides being targets, immune cells express vitamin D-activating enzymes, allowing local conversion of inactive vitamin D into 1,25(OH)2D3 within the immune system. Taken together, these data indicate that 1,25(OH)2D3 plays a role in maintenance of immune homeostasis. Several epidemiological studies have linked inadequate vitamin D levels to a higher susceptibility of immune-mediated disorders, including chronic infections and autoimmune diseases. This review will discuss the complex immune-regulatory effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on immune cells as well as its role in infectious and autoimmune diseases, more in particular in tuberculosis and type 1 diabetes (T1D).}},

Vitamin D receptor has been shown to be expressed in several types of immune cells suggesting vitamin D may have immune regulatory roles. Vitamin D insufficiency has been suggested to increase the risk of autoimmune diseases. However, little is known regarding its immunomodulatory effects in the condition of immune suppression. The aim of the present study was to investigate the regulatory effects of vitamin D on immune function in immunosuppressant mice. An immunosuppressant mouse model was induced by intraperitoneal injection with glucocorticiod for 3 days. Immunosuppressant mice were intragastrically administered with 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3; 0,4, 6 or 10 IU/g body weight] for 7 days. On day 8, the mice were decapitated. The body weight and the weights of thymus and spleen were measured. Thymus and spleen indexes were calculated. The ratio of CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, proliferation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production of spleen T lymphocytes was detected. Compared with the mice in the control group, the body weight, thymus and spleen indexes, the ratios of CD4+/CD8+ in peripheral blood and IL-2 production and proliferation of spleen T lymphocytes were decreased in immunosuppressant mice induced by glucocorticiod. However, in vitamin D-treated mice, the thymus indexes, the ratios of CD4+/CD8+, secretion of IL-2 and the proliferation index of spleen T lymphocytes were significantly increased (P<0.05). Among the three doses of 1,25(OH)2D3, 6 IU/g was most effective in improving the immune function. These results indicate that vitamin D supplementation can improve immune recovery in immunosuppressant mice by stimulating T-cell proliferation and elevating IL-2 production.}},

Certain fermented foods and probiotics may deliver viable microbes with the potential to promote gut immunity.

Different levels of evidence support the use of fermented foods, probiotics and prebiotics to promote gut and lungs immunity.

abstract = {{The world is in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and death in addition to quarantines are desperately needed. This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk. Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections. Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not. Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration. To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d. The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40–60 ng/mL (100–150 nmol/L). For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D3 doses might be useful. Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations.}},

abstract = {{Confusion, apathy, recurrent vomiting, abdominal pain, polyuria, polydipsia, and dehydration are the most often noted clinical symptoms of vitamin D toxicity (VDT; also called vitamin D intoxication or hypervitaminosis D). VDT and its clinical manifestation, severe hypercalcemia, are related to excessive long-term intake of vitamin D, malfunctions of the vitamin D metabolic pathway, or the existence of coincident disease that produces the active vitamin D metabolite locally. Although VDT is rare, the health effects can be serious if it is not promptly identified. Many forms of exogenous (iatrogenic) and endogenous VDT exist. Exogenous VDT is usually caused by the inadvertent or improper intake of extremely high doses of pharmacological preparations of vitamin D and is associated with hypercalcemia. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations higher than 150 ng/ml (375 nmol/l) are the hallmark of VDT due to vitamin D overdosing. Endogenous VDT may develop from excessive production of an active vitamin D metabolite – 1,25(OH)2D in granulomatous disorders and in some lymphomas or from the reduced degradation of that metabolite in idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia. Endogenous VDT may also develop from an excessive production of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D in congenital disorders, such as Williams–Beuren syndrome. Laboratory testing during routine clinical examinations may reveal asymptomatic hypercalcemia caused by the intake of vitamin D even in doses recommended for the general population and considered safe. That phenomenon, called hypersensitivity to vitamin D, reflects dysregulated vitamin D metabolism. Researchers have proposed many processes to explain VDT. Those processes include elevated activity of 1α-hydroxylase or inhibited activity of 24-hydroxylase, both leading to increased concentration of 1,25(OH)D; increased number of vitamin D receptors; and saturation of the capacity of vitamin D binding protein. Increased public awareness of vitamin D–related health benefits might increase the risk of VDT due to self-administration of vitamin D in doses higher then recommended for age and body weight or even higher than the established upper limit intake values. Consequently, the incidence of hypercalcemia due to hypervitaminosis D might increase.}},

Daily brief, suberythemal exposure of a substantial area of the skin to ultraviolet light, climate allowing, provides adults with a safe, physiologic amount of vitamin D, equivalent to an oral intake of about 10,000IU vitamin D3 per day, with the plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration potentially reaching 220 nmol/L (88 ng/mL). The incremental consumption of 40IU/d of vitamin D3 raises plasma 25(OH)D by about 1 nmol/L (0.4 ng/mL). High doses of vitamin D may cause hypercalcemia once the 25(OH)D concentration is well above the top of the physiologic range. The physiological buffer for vitamin D safety is the capacity of plasma vitamin D–binding protein to bind the total of circulating 25(OH)D, vitamin D, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D]. Hypercalcemia occurs when the free concentration is inappropriately high because vitamin D and its other metabolites have displaced 1,25(OH)2D from vitamin D–binding protein. Evidence from clinical trials shows, with a wide margin of confidence, that a prolonged intake of 10,000IU/d of vitamin D3 poses no risk of adverse effects for adults, even if this is added to a rather high physiologic background level of vitamin D.}},

Ninety-nine were screened, 73 were included in randomized controlled trial, and 69 completed the trial. There were no adverse events. Intervention: Four doses of 150,000 IU vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) were given over 1 yr. Main Outcome Measures: Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and jumping mechanography were used. Results: At follow-up, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] status was 56.0 ± 8.9 nmol/liter in the intervention group and 15.8 ± 6.6 nmol/liter in controls. There were no effects of supplementation on bone; however, for muscle function, efficiency of movement improved in the vitamin D-treated group. There was an interaction between baseline 25(OH)D concentration and response to vitamin D supplementation for muscle jump velocity. Conclusions: Despite improvements in 25(OH)D status, treatment with vitamin D2 was not shown to increase mineral accretion, bone geometry or strength, muscle force, or power. There were greater increases in jump velocity in girls with the lowest baseline 25(OH)D concentrations. Lack of effect of intervention after the period of peak mineral and muscle mass accretion suggests that earlier action is required.}},

Search “A” identified three main themes of indirect evidence supporting such an association. Consistent epidemiological evidence exists linking low vitamin D levels to increased risk and severity of respiratory tract infections. We also report on plausible biological processes supporting such an association; and present weaker evidence supporting the benefit of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the risk and severity of ARIs. Uncertainty remains about what constitutes an appropriate dosing regimen in relation to reducing risk/severity of ARI/ARDS. More recent evidence (Search B) provided new insights into some direct links between vitamin D and COVID-19; with a number of cohort and ecological studies supporting an association with PCR-positivity for SARS-CoV-2 and vitamin D deficiency. The exact efficacy of the vitamin D supplementation for prevention of, or as an adjunct treatment for COVID-19 remains to be determined; but a number of randomized control trials (RCTs) currently underway are actively investigating these potential benefits. Our rapid review of literature supports the need for observational studies with COVID-19 infected populations to measure and assess vitamin D levels in relation to risk/severity and outcomes; alongside RCTs designed to evaluate the efficacy of supplementation both in preventive and therapeutic contexts. The overlap in the vitamin D associated biological pathways with the dysregulation reported to drive COVID-19 outcomes warrants further investigation.}},

This training necessarily included repeated exposures to high levels of impulse noises while using ear plugs. During this placebo-controlled, double-blind study, each subject received daily an additional drink containing either 6.7 mmol (167 mg) magnesium aspartate or a similar quantity of placebo (Na-aspartate).Results: NIPTS was significantly more frequent and more severe in the placebo group than in the magnesium group, especially in bilateral damages. NIPTS was negatively correlated to the magnesium content of blood red cells but especially to the magnesium mononuclear cells. Long-term additional intake of a small dose of oral magnesium was not accompanied by any notable side effect.Concluslon: This study may introduce a significant natural agent for the reduction of hearing damages in noise-exposed population.}},

abstract = {{The renin–angiotensin system (RAS) plays a central role in the regulation of blood pressure, volume and electrolyte homeostasis. Inappropriate activation of the RAS may lead to hypertension. Clinical and epidemiological studies have suggested a correlation between Vitamin D-deficiency and high blood pressure. Our recent studies demonstrate that Vitamin D is a potent endocrine suppressor of renin biosynthesis to regulate the RAS. Mice lacking the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) have elevated production of renin and angiotensin (Ang) II, leading to hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and increased water intake. These abnormalities can be prevented by treatment with an ACE inhibitor or AT1 receptor antagonist. Vitamin D repression of renin expression is independent of calcium metabolism, the volume- and salt-sensing mechanisms and the Ang II feedback regulation. In normal mice, Vitamin D-deficiency stimulates renin expression, whereas injection of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] reduces renin synthesis. In cell cultures, 1,25(OH)2D3 directly suppresses renin gene transcription by a VDR-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, we have found that Gemini compounds have more potent renin-suppressing activity than 1,25(OH)2D3. Collectively, our studies reveal a critical role of the Vitamin D endocrine system in the regulation of blood pressure and volume homeostasis, and suggest that low calcemic Vitamin D analogs may potentially be developed into a new class of anti-hypertensive agents to control renin production and blood pressure.}},

New data continue to emerge regarding the health benefits of vitamin D beyond its role in bone. The intakes associated with those benefits suggest a need for levels of supplementation, food fortification, or both that are higher than current levels. A prevailing concern exists, however, regarding the potential for toxicity related to excessive vitamin D intakes. The UL established by the FNB for vitamin D (50 μg, or 2000 IU) is not based on current evidence and is viewed by many as being too restrictive, thus curtailing research, commercial development, and optimization of nutritional policy. Human clinical trial data published subsequent to the establishment of the FNB vitamin D UL published in 1997 support a significantly higher UL. We present a risk assessment based on relevant, well-designed human clinical trials of vitamin D. Collectively, the absence of toxicity in trials conducted in healthy adults that used vitamin D dose ≥250 μg/d (10 000 IU vitamin D3) supports the confident selection of this value as the UL.}},

abstract = {{Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin and a steroid hormone that plays a central role in maintaining calcium-phosphorus and bone homeostasis in close interaction with parathyroid hormone, acting on its classical target tissues, namely, bone, kidney, intestine, and parathyroid glands. However, vitamin D endocrine system regulates several genes (about 3 \% of the human genome) involved in cell differentiation, cell-cycle control, and cell function and exerts noncalcemic/pleiotropic effects on extraskeletal target tissues, such as immune and cardiovascular system, pancreatic endocrine cells, muscle, and adipose tissue. Several studies have demonstrated the role of vitamin D supplementation in the prevention/treatment of various autoimmune diseases and improvement of glucose metabolism, muscle, and adipose tissue function. Hence, this review aims to elucidate the effects of vitamin D on extraskeletal target tissues and to investigate the potential therapeutic benefit of vitamin D supplementation among a broad group of pathological conditions, especially with regard to metabolic and autoimmune diseases. In addition, we focused on the best daily intakes and serum levels of vitamin D required for extraskeletal benefits which, even if still controversial, appear to be higher than those widely accepted for skeletal effects.}},

Further studies are warranted to define the role of serological diagnosis and a possible correlation between serological response and prognosis. Objectives The aim was to guide clinical microbiologists in the use of these diagnostic tests and clinicians in the interpretation of their results. Sources A search of literature was performed through PubMed and Google Scholar using the keywords SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis, SARS-CoV-2 immune response, SARS-CoV-2 serology/antibody testing, coronavirus diagnosis. Content The present review discusses performances, limitations and use of current and future diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2. Implications Real-time RT-PCR remains the reference method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, notwithstanding its varying sensitivity according to the time of infection, serology represents a valid asset (a) to try to solve possible discrepancies between a highly suggestive clinical and radiological presentation and negative RT-PCR, (b) to solve discrepancies between different PCR assays and (c) for epidemiological purposes.}},

Treatments that can reduce the risk of infection and mortality from the disease are desperately needed. Though high quality randomized controlled trials are lacking, some observational and interventional studies that explore the link between vitamin D and RTIs exist. Vitamin D modulates both innate as well as adaptive immunity and may potentially prevent or mitigate the complications associated with RTIs. Evidence linking vitamin D to COVID-19 include that the outbreak occurred in winter in the northern hemisphere at a time when vitamin D levels are lowest in resident populations, that blacks and minority ethnic individuals who are known to have lower levels of vitamin D appear to be disproportionately affected and have more severe complications from the disease, that vitamin D deficiency has been shown to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome and that case fatality rates increase with age and in populations with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, all of which are associated with lower vitamin D levels. This narrative review summarizes the current knowledge about the epidemiology and pathophysiology of COVID-19, the evidence linking vitamin D and RTIs, especially COVID-19, the mechanistic reasons behind the possible protective effect of vitamin D in COVID-19, and the evidence with regard to vitamin D supplementation in RTIs.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the newly evolving human coronavirus infection that causes COVID-19, and it first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread rapidly all over the world. COVID-19 is being increasingly investigated through virology, epidemiology, and clinical management strategies. There is currently no established consensus on the standard of care in the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 patients. However, certain medications suggested for other diseases have been shown to be potentially effective for treating this infection, though there has yet to be clear evidence. Therapies include new agents that are currently tested in several clinical trials, in addition to other medications that have been repurposed as antiviral and immune-modulating therapies. Previous high-morbidity human coronavirus epidemics such as the 2003 SARS-CoV and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prompted the identification of compounds that could theoretically be active against the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, advances in molecular biology techniques and computational analysis have allowed for the better recognition of the virus structure and the quicker screening of chemical libraries to suggest potential therapies. This review aims to summarize rationalized pharmacotherapy considerations in COVID-19 patients in order to serve as a tool for health care professionals at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic. All the reviewed therapies require either additional drug development or randomized large-scale clinical trials to be justified for clinical use.}},

However 1,25(OH)2D3 also has a physiological role beyond its well-known role in skeletal homeostasis. Here, we describe 1,25(OH)2D3 as an immunomodulator targeting various immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), as well as T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes, hence modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses. Besides being targets, immune cells express vitamin D-activating enzymes, allowing local conversion of inactive vitamin D into 1,25(OH)2D3 within the immune system. Taken together, these data indicate that 1,25(OH)2D3 plays a role in maintenance of immune homeostasis. Several epidemiological studies have linked inadequate vitamin D levels to a higher susceptibility of immune-mediated disorders, including chronic infections and autoimmune diseases. This review will discuss the complex immune-regulatory effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on immune cells as well as its role in infectious and autoimmune diseases, more in particular in tuberculosis and type 1 diabetes (T1D).}},

No differences regarding demographic and clinical characteristics were found. A survival analysis highlighted that, after 10 days of hospitalization, severe vitamin D deficiency patients had a 50\% mortality probability, while those with vitamin D ≥ 10 ng/mL had a 5\% mortality risk (p = 0.019). High prevalence of hypovitaminosis D was found in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure, treated in a RICU. Patients with severe vitamin D deficiency had a significantly higher mortality risk.

abstract = {{The beneficial effects of vitamin D, together with the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, have led to an expanding use of vitamin D analogues. While inappropriate consumption is a recognized cause of harm, the determination of doses at which vitamin D becomes toxic remains elusive. A 56-year woman was admitted to our Hospital following a 3-week history of nausea, vomiting, and muscle weakness. The patient had been assuming a very high dose of cholecalciferol for 20 months (cumulative 78,000,000UI, mean daily 130,000UI), as indicated by a non-conventional protocol for multiple sclerosis. Before starting vitamin D integration, serum calcium and phosphorus levels were normal, while 25OH-vitamin D levels were very low (12.25 nmol/L). On admission, hypercalcemia (3.23 mmol/L) and acute kidney injury (eGFR 20 mL/min) were detected, associated with high concentrations of 25OH-vitamin D (920 nmol/L), confirming the suspicion of vitamin D intoxication. Vitamin D integration was stopped, and in a week, hypercalcemia normalized. It took about 6 months for renal function and 18 months for vitamin D values to go back to normal. This case confirms that vitamin D intoxication is possible, albeit with a high dose. The doses used in clinical practice are far lower than these and, therefore, intoxication rarely occurs even in those individuals whose baseline vitamin D serum levels have never been assessed. Repeated measurements of vitamin D are not necessary for patients under standard integrative therapy. However, patients and clinicians should be aware of the potential dangers of vitamin D overdose.}},

Retrospective case–control study of 216 COVID-19 patients and 197 population-based controls. Serum 25OHD levels were measured in both groups. The association of serum 25OHD levels with COVID-19 severity (admission to the intensive care unit, requirements for mechanical ventilation, or mortality) was also evaluated. Of the 216 patients, 19 were on vitamin D supplements and were analyzed separately. In COVID-19 patients, mean ± standard deviation 25OHD levels were 13.8 ± 7.2 ng/mL, compared with 20.9 ± 7.4 ng/mL in controls (P < .0001). 25OHD values were lower in men than in women. Vitamin D deficiency was found in 82.2\% of COVID-19 cases and 47.2\% of population-based controls (P < .0001). 25OHD inversely correlates with serum ferritin (P = .013) and D-dimer levels (P = .027). Vitamin D-deficient COVID-19 patients had a greater prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, raised serum ferritin and troponin levels, as well as a longer length of hospital stay than those with serum 25OHD levels ≥20 ng/mL. No causal relationship was found between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 severity as a combined endpoint or as its separate components. 25OHD levels are lower in hospitalized COVID-19 patients than in population-based controls and these patients had a higher prevalence of deficiency.

To assess the standard of studies included, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) method was used. Of the nine studies reviewed, seven (77.8\%) showed that COVID-19 infection, prognosis, and mortality were correlated with vitamin D status. Most of the articles reviewed showed that blood vitamin D status can determine the risk of being infected with COVID-19, seriousness of COVID-19, and mortality from COVID-19.

The role of vitamin D in innate and adaptive immunity is critical. A statistical error in the estimation of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D was recently discovered; in a correct analysis of the data used by the Institute of Medicine, it was found that 8895 IU/d was needed for 97.5\% of individuals to achieve values ≥50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed that 6201 IU/d was needed to achieve 75 nmol/L and 9122 IU/d was needed to reach 100 nmol/L. The largest meta-analysis ever conducted of studies published between 1966 and 2013 showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <75 nmol/L may be too low for safety and associated with higher all-cause mortality, demolishing the previously presumed U-shape curve of mortality associated with vitamin D levels. Since all-disease mortality is reduced to 1.0 with serum vitamin D levels ≥100 nmol/L, we call public health authorities to consider designating as the RDA at least three-fourths of the levels proposed by the Endocrine Society Expert Committee as safe upper tolerable daily intake doses. This could lead to a recommendation of 1000 IU for children <1 year on enriched formula and 1500 IU for breastfed children older than 6 months, 3000 IU for children >1 year of age, and around 8000 IU for young adults and thereafter.

We hypothesize that vitamin D status may influence the severity of responses to Covid-19 and that the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Europe will be closely aligned to Covid-19 mortality. Methods We conducted a literature search on PubMed (no language restriction) of vitamin D status (for older adults) in countries/areas of Europe affected by Covid-19 infection. Countries were selected by severity of infection (high and low) and were limited to national surveys or where not available, to geographic areas within the country affected by infection. Covid-19 infection and mortality data was gathered from the World Health Organisation. Results Counter-intuitively, lower latitude and typically 'sunny' countries such as Spain and Italy (particularly Northern Italy), had low mean concentrations of 25(OH)D and high rates of vitamin D deficiency. These countries have also been experiencing the highest infection and death rates in Europe. The northern latitude countries (Norway, Finland, Sweden) which receive less UVB sunlight than Southern Europe, actually had much higher mean 25(OH)D concentrations, low levels of deficiency and for Norway and Finland, lower infection and death rates. The correlation between 25(OH)D concentration and mortality rate reached conventional significance (P=0.046) by Spearman's Rank Correlation. Conclusions Optimising vitamin D status to recommendations by national and international public health agencies will certainly have benefits for bone health and potential benefits for Covid-19.

Risk groups include young children, adolescents, pregnant women, older people (especially the institutionalized) and non-Western immigrants. Consequences of vitamin D deficiency include mineralization defects and lower bone mineral density causing fractures. Extra-skeletal consequences may be muscle weakness, falls and acute respiratory infection, and are the subject of large ongoing clinical trials. The ECTS advises to improve vitamin D status by food fortification and the use of vitamin D supplements in risk groups. Fortification of foods by adding vitamin D to dairy products, bread and cereals can improve the vitamin D status of the whole population, but quality assurance monitoring is needed to prevent intoxication. Specific risk groups such as infants and children up to 3 years, pregnant women, older persons and non-Western immigrants should routinely receive vitamin D supplements. Future research should include genetic studies to better define individual vulnerability for vitamin D deficiency, and Mendelian randomization studies to address the effect of vitamin D deficiency on long-term non-skeletal outcomes such as cancer.}},

Integrating available knowledge, we hypothesised that vitamin D could play a causal role in COVID-19 outcomes. We set out to analyse the relationship between COVID-19 severity and latitude, and construct a causal inference framework to validate this hypothesis. We analysed global daily reports of fatalities and recoveries from 239 locations from 22nd Jan 2020 to 9th April 2020. We quantified local COVID-19 outbreak severity to clearly distinguish the latitude relationship and identify any outliers breaking this pattern, and analysed the timeline of spread. We then used a causal inference framework to distinguish correlation from cause using observational data with a hypothetico-deductive method of proof. We constructed two contrasting directed acyclic graph (DAG) models, one causal and one acausal with respect to vitamin D and COVID-19 severity, allowing us to make 19 verifiable and falsifiable predictions for each. Our analysis confirmed a striking correlation between COVID-19 severity and latitude, and ruled out the temporal spread of infection as an explanation. We compared observed severity for 239 locations with our contrasting model. In the causal model, 16 predictions matched observed data and 3 predictions were untestable; in the acausal model, 14 predictions strongly contradicted observed data, 2 appeared to contradict data, and 3 were untestable. We show in advance of RCTs that observed data strongly match predictions made by the causal model but contradict those of the acausal model. We present historic evidence that vitamin D supplementation prevented past respiratory virus pandemics. We discuss how molecular mechanisms of vitamin D action can prevent respiratory viral infections and protect against ARDS. We highlight vitamin D’s direct effect on the renin-angiotensin-system (RAS), which in concert with its other effects, can modify host responses thus preventing a cytokine storm and SARS-CoV-2-induced pathological changes. Emerging clinical research confirms striking correlations between hypovitaminosis D and COVID-19 severity, in full alignment with our study. Our novel causal inference analysis of global data supports the hypothesis that vitamin D levels play a key role in COVID-19 outcomes. The data set size, supporting historical, biomolecular, and emerging clinical research evidence altogether suggest that a very high level of confidence is justified. Vitamin D prophylaxis offers a widely available, low-risk, highly-scalable, and cost-effective pandemic management strategy including the mitigation of local outbreaks and a second wave. Timely implementation of vitamin D supplementation programmes worldwide is critical; initial priority should be given to those who are at the highest risk, including the elderly, immobile, homebound, BAME and healthcare professionals. Population-wide vitamin D sufficiency could prevent seasonal respiratory epidemics, decrease our dependence on pharmaceutical solutions, reduce hospitalisations, and thus greatly lower healthcare costs while significantly increasing quality of life.}},

abstract = {{As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread worldwide, it has become evident that the morbidity and mortality rates clearly vary across nations. Although several factors may account for this disparity, striking differences within and between populations indicate that ethnicity might impact COVID-19 clinical outcomes, reflecting the 'color of disease'. Therefore, the role of key biological variables that could interplay with viral spreading and severity indices has attracted increasing attention, particularly among non-Caucasian populations. Although the links between vitamin D status and the incidence and severity of COVID-19 remain elusive, several lines of emerging evidence suggest that vitamin D signaling, targeting several immune-mediated pathways, may offer potential benefits at different stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given that the vitamin D status is modulated by several intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including skin type (pigmentation), melanin polymers may also play a role in variable COVID-19 outcomes among diverse population settings. Moreover, apart from the well-known limiting effects of melanin on the endogenous production of vitamin D, the potential crosstalk between the pigmentary and immune system may also require special attention concerning the current pandemic. The present review article aimed to shed light on a range of mostly overlooked host factors, such as vitamin D status and melanin pigments, that may influence the course and outcome of COVID-19.}},

abstract = {{Due to the rapidly spreading of novel coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) worldwide, there is an urgent need to develop efficient vaccines and specific antiviral treatments. Pathways of the viral entry into cells are interesting subjects for targeted therapy of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). The present study aims to provide a systematic evaluation of the most recent in vitro and in vivo investigations targeting SARS‐CoV‐2 cell entry. A systematic search was carried out in major medical sources, including MEDLINE (through PubMed), Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE. Combinations of the following search terms were used: SARS‐CoV‐2, in vitro, in vivo, preclinical, targeted therapy, and cell entry. A modified version of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials and Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation assessment tools were applied for evaluating the risk of bias of in vitro and in vivo studies, respectively. A narrative synthesis was performed as a qualitative method for the data synthesis of each outcome measure. A total of 2,649 articles were identified through searching PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Biorxiv. Finally, 22 studies (one in vivo study and 21 in vitro studies) were included. The spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS‐CoV‐2 was the main target of investigation in 19 studies. SARS‐CoV‐2 can enter into the host cells through endocytosis or independently. SARS‐CoV‐2 S protein utilizes angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 or CD147 as its cell‐surface receptor to attach host cells. It consists of S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit mediates viral attachment to the host cells, while the S2 subunit facilitates virus‐host membrane fusion. The cleavage of the S1–S2 protein, which is required for the conformational changes of the S2 subunit and processing of viral fusion, is regulated by the host proteases, including cathepsin L (during endocytosis) and type II membrane serine protease (independently). Targeted therapy strategies against SARS‐CoV‐2 cell entry mechanisms fall into four main categories: strategies targeting virus receptors on the host, strategies neutralizing SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein, strategies targeting virus fusion to host cells, and strategies targeting endosomal and non‐endosomal dependent pathways of virus entry. Inhibition of the viral entry by targeting host or virus‐related components remains the most potent strategy to prevent and treat COVID‐19. Further high‐quality investigations are needed to assess the efficacy of the proposed targets and develop specific antivirals against SARS‐CoV‐2. SARS‐CoV‐2 S protein utilizes angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or CD147 as its cell‐surface receptor to attach host cells. Targeted therapy strategies against SARS‐CoV‐2 cell entry mechanisms fall into four main categories: strategies targeting virus receptors on the host, strategies neutralizing SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein, strategies targeting virus fusion to host cells, and strategies targeting endosomal and non‐endosomal dependent pathways of virus entry.

In the current study, Vero cells constitutively expressing type II transmembrane serine protease (Vero-TMPRSS2 cells) showed larger syncytia at 18 h after infection with MERS-CoV than after infection with other coronaviruses. Furthermore, the susceptibility of Vero-TMPRSS2 cells to MERS-CoV was 100-fold higher than that of non-TMPRSS2-expressing parental Vero cells. The serine protease inhibitor camostat, which inhibits TMPRSS2 activity, completely blocked syncytium formation but only partially blocked virus entry into Vero-TMPRSS2 cells. Importantly, the coronavirus is thought to enter cells via two distinct pathways, one mediated by TMPRSS2 at the cell surface and the other mediated by cathepsin L in the endosome. Simultaneous treatment with inhibitors of cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 completely blocked virus entry into Vero-TMPRSS2 cells, indicating that MERS-CoV employs both the cell surface and the endosomal pathway to infect Vero-TMPRSS2 cells. In contrast, a single camostat treatment suppressed MERS-CoV entry into human bronchial submucosal gland-derived Calu-3 cells by 10-fold and virus growth by 270-fold, although treatment with both camostat and (23,25)- trans -epoxysuccinyl- l -leucylamindo-3-methylbutane ethyl ester, a cathepsin inhibitor, or treatment with leupeptin, an inhibitor of cysteine, serine, and threonine peptidases, was no more efficacious than treatment with camostat alone. Further, these inhibitors were not efficacious against MERS-CoV infection of MRC-5 and WI-38 cells, which were derived from lung, but these characters differed from those of mature pneumocytes. These results suggest that a single treatment with camostat is sufficient to block MERS-CoV entry into a well-differentiated lung-derived cell line.}},

Patients and Methods We conducted a retrospective population-based study in Olmsted County, Minnesota, in the 10-year period from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2011, by using the Rochester Epidemiology Project. Individuals were eligible if they resided in Olmsted County during the study period and had a measured 25(OH)D value above 50 ng/mL. The date of the first 25(OH)D value above 50 ng/mL was considered the index date for incidence determination. Hypercalcemia, the primary vitamin D toxicity, was considered potentially associated with the 25(OH)D concentration if it was measured within 3 months of the 25(OH)D measurement, and such cases had a medical record review. Results Of 20,308 total 25(OH)D measurements, 1714 (8.4\%), 123 (0.6\%), and 37 (0.2\%) unique persons had 25(OH)D values above 50, 80 and above, and 100 ng/mL and above, respectively. The age- and sex-adjusted incidence of 25(OH)D values above 50 ng/mL increased from 9 to 233 cases per 100,000 person-years from 2002 to 2011 (P<.001), respectively, and was greatest in persons aged 65 years and older (P<.001) and in women (P<.001). Serum 25(OH)D values were not significantly related to serum calcium values (P=.20) or with the risk of hypercalcemia (P=.24). A medical record review identified 4 cases (0.2\%) in whom 25(OH)D values above 50 ng/mL were temporally associated with hypercalcemia, but only 1 case had clinical toxicity associated with the highest observed 25(OH)D value of 364 ng/mL. Conclusion The incidence of 25(OH)D values above 50 ng/mL increased significantly between 2002 and 2011 without a corresponding increase in acute clinical toxicity.}},

These epidemiological associations, if true, would have public health importance, since vitamin D insufficiency is common and correctable. We aimed to test whether genetically lowered vitamin D levels were associated with risk of asthma, atopic dermatitis, or elevated serum IgE levels, using Mendelian randomization (MR) methodology to control bias owing to confounding and reverse causation. The study employed data from the UK Biobank resource and from the SUNLIGHT, GABRIEL and EAGLE eczema consortia. Using four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) strongly associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels in 33,996 individuals, we conducted MR studies to estimate the effect of lowered 25OHD on the risk of asthma (n = 146,761), childhood onset asthma (n = 15,008), atopic dermatitis (n = 40,835), and elevated IgE level (n = 12,853) and tested MR assumptions in sensitivity analyses. None of the four 25OHD-lowering alleles were associated with asthma, atopic dermatitis, or elevated IgE levels (p ≥ 0.2). The MR odds ratio per standard deviation decrease in log-transformed 25OHD was 1.03 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.90–1.19, p = 0.63) for asthma, 0.95 (95\% CI 0.69–1.31, p = 0.76) for childhood-onset asthma, and 1.12 (95\% CI 0.92–1.37, p = 0.27) for atopic dermatitis, and the effect size on log-transformed IgE levels was −0.40 (95\% CI −1.65 to 0.85, p = 0.54). These results persisted in sensitivity analyses assessing population stratification and pleiotropy and vitamin D synthesis and metabolism pathways. The main limitations of this study are that the findings do not exclude an association between the studied outcomes and 1,25-dihydoxyvitamin D, the active form of vitamin D, the study was underpowered to detect effects smaller than an OR of 1.33 for childhood asthma, and the analyses were restricted to white populations of European ancestry. This research has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource and data from the SUNLIGHT, GABRIEL and EAGLE Eczema consortia. In this study, we found no evidence that genetically determined reduction in 25OHD levels conferred an increased risk of asthma, atopic dermatitis, or elevated total serum IgE, suggesting that efforts to increase vitamin D are unlikely to reduce risks of atopic disease.}},

Interestingly, however, when positive selection was examined in vitro in foetal thymic organ culture (FTOC), bm1 and bm8 were still poorly selective, but the bm3 haplotype now selected as efficiently as B6. The ability to select in vitro correlated with the capacity to present the ovalbumin (OVA) peptide to OT‐I cells, as measured by induction of an OVA‐specific proliferative response.

Here we show that complement triggers contraction of TH1 responses by inducing intrinsic expression of the vitamin D (VitD) receptor and the VitD-activating enzyme CYP27B1, permitting T cells to both activate and respond to VitD. VitD then initiated the transition from pro-inflammatory interferon-γ+ TH1 cells to suppressive interleukin-10+ cells. This process was primed by dynamic changes in the epigenetic landscape of CD4+ T cells, generating super-enhancers and recruiting several transcription factors, notably c-JUN, STAT3 and BACH2, which together with VitD receptor shaped the transcriptional response to VitD. Accordingly, VitD did not induce interleukin-10 expression in cells with dysfunctional BACH2 or STAT3. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid CD4+ T cells of patients with COVID-19 were TH1-skewed and showed de-repression of genes downregulated by VitD, from either lack of substrate (VitD deficiency) and/or abnormal regulation of this system. During homeostasis TH1 cells activate a cell-intrinsic inflammatory shutdown program and shift to IL-10 production.

The presence of prognostic factors such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, and age influence the expression of the disease’s clinical severity. Other elements, such as 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D3) concentrations, are currently being studied. Various studies, mostly observational, have sought to demonstrate whether there is truly a relationship between 25(OH)D3 levels and the acquisition and/or severity of the disease. The objective of this study was to carry out a review of the current data that associate vitamin D status with the acquisition, evolution, and/or severity of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and to assess whether prevention through vitamin D supplementation can prevent infection and/or improve the evolution once acquired. Vitamin D system has an immunomodulatory function and plays a significant role in various bacterial and viral infections. The immune function of vitamin D is explained in part by the presence of its receptor (VDR) and its activating enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) in immune cells. The vitamin D, VDR, and Retinoid X Receptor complex allows the transcription of genes with antimicrobial activities, such as cathelicidins and defensins. COVID-19 characteristically presents a marked hyperimmune state, with the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β. Thus, there are biological factors linking vitamin D to the cytokine storm, which can herald some of the most severe consequences of COVID-19, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. Hypovitaminosis D is widespread worldwide, so the prevention of COVID-19 through vitamin D supplementation is being considered as a possible therapeutic strategy easy to implement. However, more-quality studies and well-designed randomized clinical trials are needed to address this relevant question.}},

abstract = {{Key messages ‐ We did not find enough, good‐quality evidence to judge whether vitamin D is an effective or safe treatment for adults with COVID‐19. ‐ We need more research on this topic. Future research should focus on well‐designed studies with robust methods. ‐ We identified 21 studies on this topic that are ongoing. We will update this review when more evidence becomes available. What is the link between vitamin D and COVID‐19? Some studies have shown that people who are in hospital with severe COVID‐19 also have low levels of vitamin D (vitamin D deficiency). However, the risk factors for developing severe COVID‐19 are the same as those for developing vitamin D deficiency, so it is difficult to tell if vitamin D deficiency itself is a risk factor for severe COVID‐19. Risk factors include general ill‐health, a poor diet, and pre‐existing health conditions, such as diabetes, and liver and kidney disease. Vitamin D is important for healthy bones, teeth and muscles. It helps to regulate blood sugar, the heart and blood vessels, and the lungs and airways. It also has a role in boosting the body’s immune system. These are areas affected by COVID‐19, so giving vitamin D to people with COVID‐19 might help them to recover more quickly or have the disease less severely. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out the effects of giving vitamin D to adults with confirmed COVID‐19 on the following: ‐ death from any cause; ‐ improvement or worsening of the patient’s condition; ‐ unwanted effects; and ‐ quality of life. What did we do? We searched for studies that assessed the use of vitamin D as a treatment for adults with confirmed COVID‐19 compared with a placebo (sham treatment) or another treatment. Vitamin D could be given in any form and in any dose. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found three studies with 356 participants. One study took place in Brazil, and the other two in Spain. Two studies had participants with severe COVID‐19 and one had participants with mild COVID‐19 or with no symptoms. All the participants tested positive for COVID‐19 with a laboratory test called ‘PCR’, which is currently the most accurate test available. The studies gave their participants different doses of vitamin D. They used different timings from each other, from one large dose in one study to several smaller doses over 14 days in another study. Only two studies said that their participants were vitamin D‐deficient. The other study did not say anything about their participants’ vitamin D status. Deaths from any causeWe do not know whether vitamin D helps to prevent death from COVID‐19. Two studies (in participants with severe COVID‐19) provided evidence about deaths from any cause. One reported no deaths in the 50 participants who had received vitamin D, but two deaths in the 26 participants who received the hospital’s usual COVID‐19 treatment. The other study reported nine deaths in 119 participants who had been given vitamin D and six deaths in the 118 participants given placebo. These studies were too different from each other to allow us to draw any conclusions. Patient’s conditionVitamin D may reduce the need for patients to be put on a ventilator to help them breathe, but the evidence is uncertain. One study (in participants with severe COVID‐19) reported that nine out of 119 participants given vitamin D had to be put on a ventilator and 17 out of 118 given a placebo needed a ventilator. Unwanted effectsWe do not know whether vitamin D causes unwanted effects. Only one study (in participants with severe COVID‐19) reported data on unwanted effects in a way that we could use. It found that one participant out of 119 vomited shortly after being given vitamin D. Quality of lifeNone of the studies reported quality of life. What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence is very limited because the studies gave different doses of vitamin D at different times from each other, did not all report participants’ vitamin D status, and did not measure and record their results using consistent methods. We found little evidence on unwanted effects and none on quality of life. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is up to date to 11 March 2021.}},

abstract = {{Older adults are more likely to be vitamin D deficient. The aim of the study was to determine whether these patients have worse outcomes with COVID-19. We conducted a prospective cohort study between 1 March and 30 April 2020 to assess the importance of vitamin D deficiency in older patients with COVID-19. The cohort consisted of patients aged ≥65 years presenting with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (n=105). All patients were tested for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels during acute illness. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed via viral reverse transcriptase PCR swab or supporting radiological evidence. COVID-19-positive arm (n=70) was sub-divided into vitamin D-deficient (≤30 nmol/L) (n=39) and -replete groups (n=35). Subgroups were assessed for disease severity using biochemical, radiological and clinical markers. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were laboratory features of cytokine storm, thoracic imaging changes and requirement of non-invasive ventilation (NIV). COVID-19-positive arm demonstrated lower median serum 25(OH)D level of 27 nmol/L (IQR=20–47 nmol/L) compared with COVID-19-negative arm, with median level of 52 nmol/L (IQR=31.5–71.5 nmol/L) (p value=0.0008). Among patients with vitamin D deficiency, there was higher peak D-dimer level (1914.00 μgFEU/L vs 1268.00 μgFEU/L) (p=0.034) and higher incidence of NIV support and high dependency unit admission (30.77\% vs 9.68\%) (p=0.042). No increased mortality was observed between groups. Older adults with vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 may demonstrate worse morbidity outcomes. Vitamin D status may be a useful prognosticator.}},

In addition, vitamin D and the VDR are required for normal numbers of regulatory T-cells (iNKT and CD8αα) that have been shown to suppress experimental IBD. In the absence of vitamin D and the VDR, autoimmunity occurs in the gastrointestinal tract due to increased numbers of IL-17 and IFN-γ secreting T-cells and a concomitant reduction in regulatory T-cells.}},

Calcitriol receptors are present in more than thirty different tissues. Apart from the kidney, several tissues also possess the enzyme 1α-hydroxylase, which is able to use circulating 25(OH)D as a substrate. Serum levels of 25(OH)D are the best indicator to assess vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency, hypovitaminosis, adequacy, and toxicity. European children and young adults often have circulating 25(OH)D levels in the insufficiency range during wintertime. Elderly subjects have mean 25(OH)D levels in the insufficiency range throughout the year. In institutionalized subjects 25(OH)D levels are often in the deficiency range. There is now general agreement that a low vitamin D status is involved in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Moreover, vitamin D insufficiency can lead to a disturbed muscle function. Epidemiological data also indicate a low vitamin D status in tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, hypertension, and specific types of cancer. Some intervention trials have demonstrated that supplementation with vitamin D or its metabolites is able: (i) to reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients; (ii) to improve blood glucose levels in diabetics; (iii) to improve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. The oral dose necessary to achieve adequate serum 25(OH)D levels is probably much higher than the current recommendations of 5–15 μg/d.}},

abstract = {{Immunomodulatory actions of vitamin D have been recognised for over a quarter of a century, but it is only in the last few years that the significance of this to normal human physiology has become apparent. Two key factors have underpinned this revised perspective. Firstly, there are increasing data linking vitamin insufficiency with prevalent immune disorders. Improved awareness of low circulating levels of precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D in populations across the globe has prompted epidemiological investigations of health problems associated with vitamin D insufficiency. Prominent among these are autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes and Crohn's disease, but more recent studies indicate that infections such as tuberculosis may also be linked to low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. The second factor expanding the link between vitamin D and the immune system is our improved knowledge of the mechanisms that facilitate this association. It is now clear that cells from the immune system contain all the machinery needed to convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D to active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and for subsequent responses to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Mechanisms such as this are important for promoting antimicrobial responses to pathogens in macrophages, and for regulating the maturation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells. The latter may be a key pathway by which vitamin D controls T-lymphocyte (T-cell) function. However, T-cells also exhibit direct responses to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, notably the development of suppressor regulatory T-cells. Collectively these observations suggest that vitamin D is a key factor linking innate and adaptive immunity, and both of these functions may be compromised under conditions of vitamin D insufficiency.}},

abstract = {{1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), the active form of vitamin D3, is a central player in Ca and bone metabolism. More recently, important immunomodulatory effects have been attributed to this hormone. By binding to its receptor, the vitamin D receptor, 1,25(OH)2D3 regulates the expression of various genes and consequently affects the behaviour of different cell types within the immune system. 1,25(OH)2D3 can potently inhibit pathogenic T cells and gives rise to elevated numbers of regulatory T cells via the induction of tolerogenic dendritic cells. These immunomodulatory activities of 1,25(OH)2D3 have also been proven useful in vivo: administration of 1,25(OH)2D3 in several animal models can prevent or cure different autoimmune diseases and graft rejection. To overcome the dose-limiting side effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on Ca and bone, less calcaemic structural analogues (alone or in combination with synergistically acting drugs or bone-resorption inhibitors) have been successfully used in animal models. Furthermore, as 1,25(OH)2D3 also contributes to host defence against infectious agents by the induction of antimicrobial responses, this molecule might provide a new strategy to deal with drug-resistant infections. According to the pleiotropic effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 in the immune system, increasing epidemiological data underline the importance of adequate vitamin D intakes in reducing the risk of several autoimmune diseases and infections such as tuberculosis.}},

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is the best measure of an individual's vitamin D status and current cut-off ranges for sufficiency are debatable. Several factors contribute to vitamin D deficiency in Crohn's disease. These include inadequate exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake, impaired conversion of vitamin D to its active metabolite, increased catabolism, increased excretion and genetic variants in vitamin D hydroxylation and transport. The effects of low 25(OH)D on outcomes other than bone health are understudied in Crohn's disease. The aim of the present review is to discuss the potential roles of vitamin D and the possible levels required to achieve them. Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin D may have roles in innate and adaptive immunity, in the immune-pathogenesis of Crohn's disease, prevention of Crohn's disease-related hospitalisations and surgery, in reducing disease severity and in colon cancer prevention. The present literature appears to suggest that 25(OH)D concentrations of ≥75 nmol/l may be required for non-skeletal effects; however, further research on optimal levels is required.}},

We searched CINHAL, Cochrane library, EMBASE, PubMED, Scopus, and Web of Science up to 30.05.2021 for observational studies on association between vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency and susceptibility to COVID-19, severe disease and death among adults, and, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing vitamin D treatment against standard care or placebo, in improving severity or mortality among adults with COVID-19. Risk of bias was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa scale for observational studies and AUB-KQ1 Cochrane tool for RCTs. Study-level data were analyzed using RevMan 5.3 and R (v4∙1∙0). Heterogeneity was determined by I 2 and sources were explored through pre-specified sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses and meta-regressions. Of 1877 search results, 76 studies satisfying eligibility criteria were included. Seventy-two observational studies were included in the meta-analysis (n=1976099). Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency increased the odds of developing COVID-19 (OR 1∙46, 95\% CI 1∙28–1∙65, p<0∙0001, I 2=92\%), severe disease (OR 1∙90, 95\% CI 1∙52–2∙38, p<0.0001, I 2=81\%) and death (OR 2∙07, 95\% CI 1∙28–3∙35, p=0.003, I 2=73\%). 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration were lower in individuals with COVID-19 compared to controls (mean difference [MD] -3∙85 ng/mL, 95\% CI -5∙44,-2∙26, p=<0.0001), in patients with severe COVID-19 compared to controls with non-severe COVID19 (MD -4∙84 ng/mL, 95\% CI -7∙32,-2∙35, p=0∙0001) and in non-survivors compared to survivors (MD -4∙80 ng/mL, 95\%-CI -7∙89,-1∙71, p=0∙002). The association between vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency and death was insignificant when studies with high risk of bias or studies reporting unadjusted effect estimates were excluded. Risk of bias and heterogeneity were high across all analyses. Discrepancies in timing of vitamin D testing, definitions of severe COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency partly explained the heterogeneity. Four RCTs were widely heterogeneous precluding meta-analysis. Multiple observational studies involving nearly two million adults suggest vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency increases susceptibility to COVID-19 and severe COVID-19, although with a high risk of bias and heterogeneity. Association with mortality was less robust. Heterogeneity in RCTs precluded their meta-analysis.}},

Methods: Systematic literature searches of PubMed, Scopus, and Embase database up until 9 December 2020. We include published observational prospective and retrospective studies with information on 25-OHD that reported main/secondary outcome. Low serum 25-OHD refers to participants with serum 25-OHD level below a cut-off point ranging from 20 to 30 ng/mL. Other cut-off values were excluded to reduce heterogeneity. The main outcome was mortality defined as non-survivor/death. The secondary outcome was susceptibility and severe COVID-19. Results: There were 14 studies comprising of 999,179 participants. Low serum 25-OHD was associated with higher rate of COVID-19 infection compared to the control group (OR = 2.71 [1.72, 4.29], p < 0.001; I2: 92.6\%). Higher rate of severe COVID-19 was observed in patients with low serum 25-OHD (OR = 1.90 [1.24, 2.93], p = 0.003; I2: 55.3\%), with a sensitivity of 83\%, specificity of 39\%, PLR of 1.4, NLR of 0.43, and DOR of 3. Low serum 25-OHD was associated with higher mortality (OR = 3.08 [1.35, 7.00], p = 0.011; I2: 80.3\%), with a sensitivity of 85\%, specificity of 35\%, PLR of 1.3, NLR of 0.44, and DOR of 3. Meta-regression analysis showed that the association between low serum 25-OHD and mortality was affected by male gender (OR = 1.22 [1.08, 1.39], p = 0.002), diabetes (OR = 0.88 [0.79, 0.98], p = 0.019).

Patients: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between 5 February and 5 May 2020 in five hospitals in the South of Spain. Intervention: Patients received calcifediol (25-hydroxyvitamin D3) treatment (0.266 mg/capsule, 2 capsules on entry and then one capsule on day 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28) or not.

The design was a randomized controlled trial with 2 groups with evaluation every 3 months for one year: (a) CaCO3 1200 mg/day with 10 000 IU vitamin D3/day or (b) CaCO3 1200 mg/day with 600 IU vitamin D3/day. This study was conducted in an ambulatory research centre in healthy, white postmenopausal women. Serum and 24‐hour urine calcium were measured. Hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria occurred in both groups. At the final visit, 19/48 in the high dose D group had hypercalciuria. The odds of developing hypercalciuria were 3.6 [OR = 3.6(1.39, 9.3)] times higher in the high dose D group. The odds of developing hypercalcaemia did not differ between groups. The safe upper level of vitamin D recommended by the Endocrine Society when accompanied by calcium supplements results in frequent hypercalciuria. The risk of kidney stones at these levels should be investigated.}},

Methods We recruited 36,282 postmenopausal women, 50 to 79 years of age, who were already enrolled in a Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial. We randomly assigned participants to receive 1000 mg of elemental calcium as calcium carbonate with 400 IU of vitamin D3 daily or placebo. Fractures were ascertained for an average follow-up period of 7.0 years. Bone density was measured at three WHI centers. Results Hip bone density was 1.06 percent higher in the calcium plus vitamin D group than in the placebo group (P<0.01). Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip fracture (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture (0.74 to 1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (0.91 to 1.02). The risk of renal calculi increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.97). Effects did not vary significantly according to prerandomization serum vitamin D levels. Conclusions Among healthy postmenopausal women, calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density, did not significantly reduce hip fracture, and increased the risk of kidney stones.

After systematically searching PubMed, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, and the Wanfang Database, we conducted a meta-analysis. Thirty-two observational studies involving 23,228 participants were included. Meta-analysis of these studies showed that of stone formers (SFs), calcium SFs had significantly higher concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D (weighted mean difference (WMD), 10.19 pg/mL; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 4.31–16.07; p = 0.0007 and WMD, 11.28 pg/mL; 95\% CI, 4.07–18.50; p = 0.002, respectively) than non-stone formers, while the levels of 25(OH)D (WMD, 0.88 ng/mL; 95\% CI, −1.04–2.80; p = 0.37 and WMD, −0.63 ng/mL; 95\% CI, −2.72–1.47; p = 0.56, respectively) are similar.

However, worldwide reports have highlighted a variety of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency diseases. Despite many publications and scientific meetings reporting advances in vitamin D science, a disturbing realization is growing that the newer scientific and clinical knowledge is not being translated into better human health. Over the past several decades, the biological sphere of influence of vitamin D3, as defined by the tissue distribution of the VDR, has broadened at least 9-fold from the target organs required for calcium homeostasis (intestine, bone, kidney, and parathyroid). Now, research has shown that the pluripotent steroid hormone 1α,25(OH)2D3 initiates the physiologic responses of ≥36 cell types that possess the VDR. In addition to the kidney's endocrine production of circulating 1α,25(OH)2D3, researchers have found a paracrine production of this steroid hormone in ≥10 extrarenal organs. This article identifies the fundamentals of the vitamin D endocrine system, including its potential for contributions to good health in 5 physiologic arenas in which investigators have clearly documented new biological actions of 1α,25(OH)2D3 through the VDR. As a consequence, the nutritional guidelines for vitamin D3 intake (defined by serum hydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations) should be reevaluated, taking into account the contributions to good health that all 36 VDR target organs can provide.}},

However, vitamin D deficiency has been reported in several chronic conditions associated with increased inflammation and deregulation of the immune system, such as diabetes, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. These observations, together with experimental studies, suggest a critical role for vitamin D in the modulation of immune function. This leads to the hypothesis of a disease-specific alteration of vitamin D metabolism and reinforces the role of vitamin D in maintaining a healthy immune system. Two key observations validate this important non-classical action of vitamin D: first, vitamin D receptor (VDR) is expressed by the majority of immune cells, including B and T lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells; second, there is an active vitamin D metabolism by immune cells that is able to locally convert 25(OH)D3 into 1,25(OH)2D3, its active form. Vitamin D and VDR signaling together have a suppressive role on autoimmunity and an anti-inflammatory effect, promoting dendritic cell and regulatory T-cell differentiation and reducing T helper Th 17 cell response and inflammatory cytokines secretion. This review summarizes experimental data and clinical observations on the potential immunomodulating properties of vitamin D.}},

abstract = {{Vitamin D is a compound responsible for maintaining mineral homeostasis. It protects against calcium and phosphate deficiency through the effects on the intestine, kidney, parathyroid gland and bone. All mechanisms that help maintain mineral homeostasis of the body are regulated by the vitamin D hormonal form - calcitriol. Synthesis of vitamin D starts in the skin as a non-enzymatic process, which begins during exposure to sunlight, when the absorption of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation results in convertion of 7-dehydrocholesterol, a metabolite of cholesterol that is stored in the skin, to precholecalciferol (previtamin-D₃) that is immediately converted into cholecalciferol (vitamin D₃). After the skin synthesis cholecalciferol is transported to the liver where it undergoes hydroxylation, what results in formation of calcidiol (25(OH)D₃). The second metabolic process takes place in the kidney, where calcidiol undergoes hydroxylation at the C-1 position to the hormonal, the most active metabolite - 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol). Vitamin D deficiency may result in bone diseases, such as rickets in children and osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults. Symptoms of osteomalacia affect mainly the skeletal system and are similar to that observed in rickets. It concerns thoracic kyphosis, pelvis deformities and also the varus knee. Osteoporosis is another condition that is related to abnormalities of mineral homeostasis. It is characterized by the progressive loss of bone mass, impaired bone microarchitecture, and consequently increased fragility and susceptibility to fracture. For the last several years other, non-classic actions of vitamin D₃ have been discussed. It was engendered by the discovery of vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) in the most of body tissues and cells. Hence, there are many hypotheses which suggest the inverse relationship between vitamin D status and various diseases, such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, diabetes mellitus and others.}},

The precise mode of action and the full spectrum of activities of the vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D], can now be better evaluated by critical analysis of mice with engineered deletion of the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Absence of a functional VDR or the key activating enzyme, 25-OHD-1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), in mice creates a bone and growth plate phenotype that mimics humans with the same congenital disease or severe vitamin D deficiency. The intestine is the key target for the VDR because high calcium intake, or selective VDR rescue in the intestine, restores a normal bone and growth plate phenotype. The VDR is nearly ubiquitously expressed, and almost all cells respond to 1,25-(OH)2D exposure; about 3\% of the mouse or human genome is regulated, directly and/or indirectly, by the vitamin D endocrine system, suggesting a more widespread function. VDR-deficient mice, but not vitamin D- or 1α-hydroxylase-deficient mice, and man develop total alopecia, indicating that the function of the VDR and its ligand is not fully overlapping. The immune system of VDR- or vitamin D-deficient mice is grossly normal but shows increased sensitivity to autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease or type 1 diabetes after exposure to predisposing factors. VDR-deficient mice do not have a spontaneous increase in cancer but are more prone to oncogene- or chemocarcinogen-induced tumors. They also develop high renin hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and increased thrombogenicity. Vitamin D deficiency in humans is associated with increased prevalence of diseases, as predicted by the VDR null phenotype.

Cholecalciferol therapy increased serum 25(OH)D levels four-fold, monocyte vitamin D receptor expression three-fold, and 24-hydroxylase expression; therapy decreased monocyte 1α-hydroxylase levels. The CD16+ “inflammatory” monocyte subset responded to 25(OH)D repletion the most, demonstrating the greatest increase in vitamin D receptor expression after cholecalciferol.

Factors that influence cutaneous vitamin D production include sunscreen use, skin pigmentation, time of day, season of the year, latitude, and aging. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is the measure for vitamin D status. A total of 100 IU of vitamin D raises blood level of 25(OH)D by 1 ng/ml. Thus, children and adults who do not receive adequate vitamin D from sun exposure need at least 1000 IU/d vitamin D. Lack of sun exposure and vitamin D deficiency have been linked to many serious chronic diseases, including autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, cardiovascular disease, and deadly cancers. It is estimated that there is a 30 to 50\% reduction in risk for developing colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer by either increasing vitamin D intake to least 1000 IU/d vitamin D or increasing sun exposure to raise blood levels of 25(OH)D >30 ng/ml. Most tissues in the body have a vitamin D receptor. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, is made in many different tissues, including colon, prostate, and breast. It is believed that the local production of 1,25(OH)2D may be responsible for the anticancer benefit of vitamin D.

Several mechanisms have been proposed for the role of vitamin D in COVID-19, including modulation of immune and inflammatory responses, regulation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, and involvement in glucose metabolism and cardiovascular system. Low 25(OH)D concentrations might predispose patients with COVID-19 to severe outcomes not only via the associated hyperinflammatory syndrome but also by worsening preexisting impaired glucose metabolism and cardiovascular diseases. Some randomized controlled trials have shown that vitamin D supplementation is beneficial for reducing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA positivity but not for reducing intensive care unit admission or all-cause mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Current evidence suggests that taking a vitamin D supplement to maintain a serum concentration of 25(OH)D of at least 30 ng/mL (preferred range 40–60 ng/mL), can help reduce the risk of COVID-19 and its severe outcomes, including mortality. Although further well designed studies are warranted, it is prudent to recommend vitamin D supplements to people with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic according to international guidelines.}},

Similar differences were found when comparing COVID-19 patients who died in hospital [13.2 ± 6.4 ng/mL and 45.0 (28.0–99.0) pg/mL] with survivors [19.3 ± 12.0 ng/mL, p = 0.035 and 21.0 (10.5–45.9) pg/mL, p = 0.018, respectively). 25OHD levels inversely correlated with: i) IL-6 levels (ρ − 0.284, p = 0.004); ii) the subsequent need of the ICU admission [relative risk, RR 0.99, 95\% confidence interval (95\%CI) 0.98–1.00, p = 0.011] regardless of age, gender, presence of at least 1 comorbidity among obesity, diabetes, arterial hypertension, creatinine, IL-6 and lactate dehydrogenase levels, neutrophil cells, lymphocytes and platelets count; iii) mortality (RR 0.97, 95\%CI, 0.95–0.99, p = 0.011) regardless of age, gender, presence of diabetes, IL-6 and C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels, neutrophil cells, lymphocytes and platelets count. In our COVID-19 patients, low 25OHD levels were inversely correlated with high IL-6 levels and were independent predictors of COVID-19 severity and mortality.}},

Therefore, preventive health measures that can reduce the risk of infection, progression and severity are desperately needed. This review discussed the possible roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory tract infections and severity. Moreover, this study determined the correlation of vitamin D levels with COVID-19 cases and deaths in 20 European countries as of 20 May 2020. A significant negative correlation (p =0.033) has been observed between mean vitamin D levels and COVID-19 cases per one million population in European countries. However, the correlation of vitamin D with COVID-19 deaths of these countries was not significant. Some retrospective studies demonstrated a correlation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality, while other studies did not find the correlation when confounding variables are adjusted. Several studies demonstrated the role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of acute viral respiratory tract infections and pneumonia. These include direct inhibition with viral replication or with anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory ways. In the meta-analysis, vitamin D supplementation has been shown as safe and effective against acute respiratory tract infections. Thus, people who are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency during this global pandemic should consider taking vitamin D supplements to maintain the circulating 25(OH)D in the optimal levels (75–125nmol/L). In conclusion, there is not enough evidence on the association between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 severity and mortality. Therefore, randomized control trials and cohort studies are necessary to test this hypothesis.}},

It is unknown whether COVID-19 incidence is associated with vitamin D deficiency and treatment. To examine whether vitamin D deficiency and treatment are associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Retrospective cohort study University of Chicago Medicine Patients tested for COVID-19 from 3/3/2020-4/10/2020. Vitamin D deficiency was defined by the most recent 25-hydroxycholecalciferol <20ng/ml or 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol <18pg/ml within 1 year before COVID-19 testing. Treatment was defined by the most recent vitamin D type and dose, and treatment changes between the time of the most recent vitamin D level and time of COVID-19 testing. Vitamin D deficiency and treatment changes were combined to categorize vitamin D status at the time of COVID-19 testing as likely deficient (last-level-deficient/treatment-not-increased), likely sufficient(last-level-not-deficient/treatment-not-decreased), or uncertain deficiency(last-level-deficient/treatment-increased or last-level-not-deficient/treatment-decreased). The main outcome was testing positive for COVID-19. Multivariable analysis tested whether the most recent vitamin D level and treatment changes after that level were associated with testing positive for COVID-19 controlling for demographic and comorbidity indicators. Bivariate analyses of associations of treatment with vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 were performed. Among 4,314 patients tested for COVID-19, 499 had a vitamin D level in the year before testing. Vitamin D status at the time of COVID-19 testing was categorized as likely deficient for 127(25\%) patients, likely sufficient for 291(58\%) patients, and uncertain for 81(16\%) patients. In multivariate analysis, testing positive for COVID-19 was associated with increasing age(RR(age<50)=1.05,p<0.021;RR(age≥50)=1.02,p<0.064)), non-white race(RR=2.54,p<0.01) and being likely vitamin D deficient (deficient/treatment-not-increased:RR=1.77,p<0.02) as compared to likely vitamin D sufficient(not-deficient/treatment-not-decreased), with predicted COVID-19 rates in the vitamin D deficient group of 21.6\%(95\%CI[14.0\%-29.2\%]) versus 12.2\%(95\%CI[8.9\%-15.4\%]) in the vitamin D sufficient group. Vitamin D deficiency declined with increasing vitamin D dose, especially of vitamin D3. Vitamin D dose was not significantly associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency that is not sufficiently treated is associated with COVID-19 risk. Testing and treatment for vitamin D deficiency to address COVID-19 warrant aggressive pursuit and study.}},

In this context, it is interesting to evaluate the preventive and therapeutic effects of existing pharmacological agents that could be useful. In this regard, vitamin D supplementation, particularly in individuals likely to be deficient, may be a promising option. Vitamin D is a hormone that modulates many of the same inflammatory and oxidative signaling pathways triggered during COVID-19. For example, vitamin D suppresses the actions of the renin-angiotensin system, which has a determining role in the pathophysiology of the inflammatory response related to COVID-19. This paper analyzes the evidence that vitamin D supplementation might be a valuable preventive/therapeutic measure in groups at risk for or infected with COVID-19.

This review aims to consolidate the research surrounding the role of vitamin D in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. While there are some conflicting results reported, the consensus is that vitamin D has a host of immunomodulatory effects which may be beneficial in the context of COVID-19 and that low levels of vitamin D can result in dysfunction of crucial antimicrobial effects, potentially contributing to poor prognosis. Studies also show that the effects of low vitamin D can be mitigated via supplementation, although the benefits of vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of COVID-19 remain controversial.}},

The term “supplementation” has been used in the context of cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol, calcidiol, and calcitriol. In nature, by far the major form of vitamin D that nurtures the body is cholecalciferol. In contrast, ergocalciferol is primarily a synthetic and less stable product which is less potent per microgram dose than is cholecalciferol. Calcidol is the major circulating metabolite of cholecalciferol, while calcitriol is the hormone that upregulates the active transport of calcium from the gut, and which suppresses parathyroid hormone secretion. Nutrition policy papers and guidelines leave unstated the obvious fact that calcidiol and calcitriol are not nutrients, and that those metabolites are not pertinent to food fortification or dietary supplementation. Recent evidence shows that ergocalciferol is not stable with storage, and it is far more susceptible to breakdown with cooking and baking than is cholecalciferol. Therefore, it must be concluded that cholecalciferol is the only form of vitamin D that should be considered in the context of the nutritional functions of fortification and supplementation.}},

Most observational and ecological studies report association of higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations with improved outcomes for several chronic, communicable and non-communicable diseases. Consequently, numerous agencies and scientific organizations have developed recommendations for vitamin D supplementation and guidance on optimal serum 25(OH)D concentrations. The bone-centric guidelines recommend a target 25(OH)D concentration of 20ng/mL (50nmol/L), and age-dependent daily vitamin D doses of 400–800IU. The guidelines focused on pleiotropic effects of vitamin D recommend a target 25(OH)D concentration of 30ng/mL (75nmol/L), and age-, body weight-, disease-status, and ethnicity dependent vitamin D doses ranging between 400 and 2000IU/day. The wise and balanced choice of the recommendations to follow depends on one's individual health outcome concerns, age, body weight, latitude of residence, dietary and cultural habits, making the regional or nationwide guidelines more applicable in clinical practice. While natural sources of vitamin D can raise 25(OH)D concentrations, relative to dietary preferences and latitude of residence, in the context of general population, these sources are regarded ineffective to maintain the year-round 25(OH)D concentrations in the range of 30–50ng/mL (75–125nmol/L). Vitamin D self-administration related adverse effects, such as hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria are rare, and usually result from taking extremely high doses of vitamin D for a prolonged time.}},

Despite an emerging body of evidence suggesting several plausible explanations for the greater bioefficacy of vitamin D3, the form of vitamin D used in major preparations of prescriptions in North America is vitamin D2. The case that vitamin D2 should no longer be considered equivalent to vitamin D3 is based on differences in their efficacy at raising serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, diminished binding of vitamin D2 metabolites to vitamin D binding protein in plasma, and a nonphysiologic metabolism and shorter shelf life of vitamin D2. Vitamin D2, or ergocalciferol, should not be regarded as a nutrient suitable for supplementation or fortification.}},

abstract = {{Due to the implementation of the Montreal Protocol, which has limited, and is now probably reversing, the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer, only modest increases in solar UV-B radiation at the surface of the Earth have occurred. For many fair-skinned populations, changing behaviour with regard to exposure to the sun over the past half century - more time in the sun, less clothing cover (more skin exposed), and preference for a tan - has probably contributed more to greater levels of exposure to UV-B radiation than ozone depletion. Exposure to UV-B radiation has both adverse and beneficial effects on human health. This report focuses on an assessment of the evidence regarding these outcomes that has been published since our previous report in 2010. The skin and eyes are the organs exposed to solar UV radiation. Excessive solar irradiation causes skin cancer, including cutaneous malignant melanoma and the non-melanoma skin cancers, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and contributes to the development of other rare skin cancers such as Merkel cell carcinoma. Although the incidence of melanoma continues to increase in many countries, in some locations, primarily those with strong sun protection programmes, incidence has stabilised or decreased over the past 5 years, particularly in younger age-groups. However, the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers is still increasing in most locations. Exposure of the skin to the sun also induces systemic immune suppression that may have adverse effects on health, such as through the reactivation of latent viral infections, but also beneficial effects through suppression of autoimmune reactivity. Solar UV-B radiation damages the eyes, causing cataracts and pterygium. UV-B irradiation of the skin is the main source of vitamin D in many geographic locations. Vitamin D plays a critical role in the maintenance of calcium homeostasis in the body; severe deficiency causes the bone diseases, rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Although many studies have implicated vitamin D deficiency in a wide range of diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, more recent evidence is less compelling, with meta-analyses of supplementation trials failing to show a beneficial effect on the health outcomes that have been tested. It continues to be difficult to provide public health messages to guide safe exposure to the sun that are accurate, simple, and can be used by people with different skin types, in different locations, and for different times of the year or day. There is increasing interest in relating sun protection messages to the UV Index. Current sun protection strategies are outlined and assessed. Climatic factors affect the amount of UV radiation received by the skin and eyes, separately from the effect of ozone depletion. For example, cloud cover can decrease or increase the intensity of UV radiation at Earth’s surface and warmer temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns may alter the amount of time people spend outdoors and their choice of clothing. The combination of changes in climate and UV radiation may affect the number of pathogenic microorganisms in surface waters, and could have an impact on food security through effects on plant and aquatic systems. It remains difficult to quantify these effects and their possible importance for human health.}},

However, its active metabolite calcitriol [1α,25(OH)2D] performs pleiotropic effects in the cardiovascular, neurological, and adipose tissue as well as immune cells. Calcitriol exerts its effects through genomic mechanisms modulated by the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) complex, to bind to vitamin D response elements (VDRE) in target genes of several cells such as activated T and B lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells; besides of its genomic mechanisms, VDR performs novel non-genomic mechanisms that involve its membrane expression and soluble form; highlighting that vitamin D could be an immunomodulatory nutrient that plays a key role during physiological and pathological events.

abstract = {{The term vitamin D is generally used to describe a number of chemically related compounds with common antirachiiic properties, but which have differences in the rapidity of their action, the way they are produced in the body, and the conditions under which their results are optimal. Ergocalciferol, cholecalciferol, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (calcifediol), dihydrotachy -sterol, 1 α-hydroxy cholecalciferol (alfacalcidol), and 1,25 -dihydroxy cholecalciferol (calcitriol) are currently the most commonly used vitamin D metabolites. In man, cholecalciferol produced on the skin and the fraction obtained from the diet in the gastrointestinal tract are converted in the liver to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol and then in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. The demonstration of these metabolic pathways has helped to elucidate the aetiology of such conditions as hepatobiliary osteodystrophy, drug-induced anticonvulsant osteomalacia, the hypocalcaemia of hypoparathyroidism and above all azotaemic osteodystrophy. In the therapy of azotaemic osteodystrophy, the period of ‘vitamin D resistance’ when large doses of vitamin D2and Z3had to be used is now over, and these patients can be efficiently and successfully treated with almost physiological doses of 1 α-hydroxycholecalciferol and 1,25- dihydroxycholecalciferol. Attention to diet, calcium supplements and oral phosphate binders are also important. During repetitive haemodialysis, the above principles still hold true, but in some of these patients an osteomalacic syndrome resistant to 1,25 - dihydroxycholecalciferol has been recognised. These patients readily become hypercalcaemic when given 1,25- dihydrox-ycholecalciferol and their fractures and osteomalacia do not improve. Aluminium intoxication, possibly related to the use of impure dialysis fluid, is currently thought to be the most likely explanation of this dialysis osteomalacic syndrome.}},

abstract = {{Modest and even severe vitamin D deficiency is widely prevalent around the world. There is consensus that a good vitamin D status is necessary for bone and general health. Similarly, a better vitamin D status is essential for optimal efficacy of antiresorptive treatments. Supplementation of food with vitamin D or using vitamin D supplements is the most widely used strategy to improve the vitamin status. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) are the most widely used compounds and the relative use of both products depends on historical or practical reasons. Oral intake of calcifediol (25OHD3) rather than vitamin D itself should also be considered for oral supplementation. We reviewed all publications dealing with a comparison of oral cholecalciferol with oral calcifediol as to define the relative efficacy of both compounds for improving the vitamin D status. First, oral calcifediol results in a more rapid increase in serum 25OHD compared to oral cholecalciferol. Second, oral calcifediol is more potent than cholecalciferol, so that lower dosages are needed. Based on the results of nine RCTs comparing physiologic doses of oral cholecalciferol with oral calcifediol, calcifediol was 3.2-fold more potent than oral cholecalciferol. Indeed, when using dosages ≤ 25 μg/day, serum 25OHD increased by 1.5 ± 0.9 nmol/l for each 1 μg cholecalciferol, whereas this was 4.8 ± 1.2 nmol/l for oral calcifediol. Third, oral calcifediol has a higher rate of intestinal absorption and this may have important advantages in case of decreased intestinal absorption capacity due to a variety of diseases. A potential additional advantage of oral calcifediol is a linear dose-response curve, irrespective of baseline serum 25OHD, whereas the rise in serum 25OHD is lower after oral cholecalciferol, when baseline serum 25OHD is higher. Finally, intermittent intake of calcifediol results in fairly stable serum 25OHD compared with greater fluctuations after intermittent oral cholecalciferol.}},

These correlations warrant investigation into the potential use of vitamin D in the treatment of patients with autoimmune diseases. In recent years, several clinical trials have been performed to investigate the therapeutic value of vitamin D in multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, type I diabetes, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Additionally, a second angle of investigation has focused on unraveling the molecular pathways used by vitamin D in order to find new potential therapeutic targets.

abstract = {{The complement system is an evolutionary old and crucial component of innate immunity, which is key to the detection and removal of invading pathogens. It was initially discovered as a liver-derived sentinel system circulating in serum, the lymph, and interstitial fluids that mediate the opsonization and lytic killing of bacteria, fungi, and viruses and the initiation of the general inflammatory responses. Although work performed specifically in the last five decades identified complement also as a critical instructor of adaptive immunity—indicating that complement’s function is likely broader than initially anticipated—the dominant opinion among researchers and clinicians was that the key complement functions were in principle defined. However, there is now a growing realization that complement activity goes well beyond “classic” immune functions and that this system is also required for normal (neuronal) development and activity and general cell and tissue integrity and homeostasis. Furthermore, the recent discovery that complement activation is not confined to the extracellular space but occurs within cells led to the surprising understanding that complement is involved in the regulation of basic processes of the cell, particularly those of metabolic nature—mostly via novel crosstalks between complement and intracellular sensor, and effector, pathways that had been overlooked because of their spatial separation. These paradigm shifts in the field led to a renaissance in complement research and provide new platforms to now better understand the molecular pathways underlying the wide-reaching effects of complement functions in immunity and beyond. In this review, we will cover the current knowledge about complement’s emerging relationship with the cellular metabolism machinery with a focus on the functional differences between serum-circulating versus intracellularly active complement during normal cell survival and induction of effector functions. We will also discuss how taking a closer look into the evolution of key complement components not only made the functional connection between complement and metabolism rather “predictable” but how it may also give clues for the discovery of additional roles for complement in basic cellular processes.}},

To better understand the role of vitamin D deficiency in the disease course of COVID-19, we undertook a retrospective case-control study in North West England. To examine whether hospitalization with COVID-19 is more prevalent in individuals with lower vitamin D levels. The study included individuals with test results for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) between April 1, 2020, and January 29, 2021, from 2 districts in North West England. The last 25(OH)D level in the previous 12 months was categorized as “deficient” if less than 25 nmol/L and “insufficient” if 25 to 50 nmol/L. The study included 80 670 participants. Of these, 1808 were admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, of whom 670 died. In a primary cohort, median serum 25(OH)D in nonhospitalized participants with COVID-19 was 50.0 nmol/L (interquartile range [IQR], 34.0-66.7) vs 35.0 nmol/L (IQR, 21.0-57.0) in those admitted with COVID-19 (P < 0.005).

Age-, sex-, and season-adjusted odds ratios for hospital admission were 2.3 to 2.4 times higher among participants with serum 25(OH)D <50 nmol/L compared with those with normal serum 25(OH)D levels, without excess mortality risk. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. Widespread measurement of serum 25(OH)D and treatment of insufficiency or deficiency may reduce this risk.}},

During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, vitamin D levels have been put into relation with both the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19. The results from different studies are, however, not conclusive, since several variables impact on this relationship. In this study, we investigated the impact of the stringent confinement during the March–April 2020 lockdown on vitamin D levels and the relationship with the recorded sun exposure in the considered area (Milano, Italy). Furthermore, we investigated the eventual relationship between vitamin D levels and SARS-CoV-2 infection in different age groups throughout the pandemic, including the first and second wave, as well as the lockdown and between-lockdown periods. Taken together, our data suggest that 25-(OH)D levels are neither related with sun exposure nor with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Background. We investigated the changes in 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25-(OH)D] concentrations values, during the first and the second pandemic waves and the impact of the lockdown periods, with their different approaches to home confinement, among different age groups. Methods. Daily cloud-modified vitamin D UV dose (UVDVC), for the area of interest (Milano, Italy), was obtained. Single-center 25-(OH)D determinations from 40,996 individuals in a 2019 (pre-pandemic), 32,355 individuals from 1 January to 31 August 2020 (containing the first pandemic wave) and 27,684 individuals from 1 June to 30 November 2020 (containing the second wave) were compared to investigate both the effect of the lockdown on vitamin D status and the association between 25-(OH)D and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Results. No direct association was found between UVDVC, 25-(OH)D status and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The stringent confinement implemented during the first wave lockdown has not had any effect on 25-(OH)D status, although some peculiar time-restricted profile behaviors can be deduced, possibly due to vitamin D supplementation habits and features of those patients who presented to the hospital during the lockdown period. Conclusions. Although our data do not suggest any direct relationship between 25-(OH)D status, sun exposure, and SARS-CoV-2 infection, an indirect protective role cannot be excluded.}},

COVID-19 is caused by a highly infectious novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), leading to an acute infectious disease with mild-to-severe clinical symptoms such as flu-like symptoms, fever, headache, dry cough, muscle pain, loss of smell and taste, increased shortness of breath, bilateral viral pneumonia, conjunctivitis, acute respiratory distress syndromes, respiratory failure, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), sepsis, etc. While physicians and scientists have yet to discover a treatment, it is imperative that we urgently address 2 questions: how to prevent infection in immunologically naive individuals and how to treat severe symptoms such as CRS, acute respiratory failure, and the loss of somatosensation. Previous studies from the 1918 influenza pandemic have suggested vitamin D’s non-classical role in reducing lethal pneumonia and case fatality rates. Recent clinical trials also reported that vitamin D supplementation can reduce incidence of acute respiratory infection and the severity of respiratory tract diseases in adults and children. According to our literature search, there are no similar findings of clinical trials that have been published as of July 1st, 2020, in relation to the supplementation of vitamin D in the potential prevention and treatment for COVID-19. In this review, we summarize the potential role of vitamin D extra-renal metabolism in the prevention and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to bring us slightly closer to fulfilling that goal. We will focus on 3 major topics here: Vitamin D might aid in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection: Vitamin D: Overview of Renal and Extra-renal metabolism and regulation. Vitamin D: Overview of molecular mechanism and multifaceted functions beyond skeletal homeostasis. Vitamin D: Overview of local immunomodulation in human infectious diseases. Anti-viral infection. Anti-malaria and anti-systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Vitamin D might act as a strong immunosuppressant inhibiting cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19: Vitamin D: Suppression of key pro-inflammatory pathways including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Vitamin D might prevent loss of neural sensation in COVID-19 by stimulating expression of neurotrophins like Nerve Growth Factor (NGF): Vitamin D: Induction of key neurotrophic factors. .}},

We explored its effect on the expression of these markers on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in vitro, and their potential correlations in vivo. CD38 and HLA-DR expression was measured by flow cytometry in PHA/IL-2-activated mononuclear cells cultured under VitD precursors: three cholecalciferol (10−11M, 10−9M, 10−7M; n=11) and two calcidiol (40 ng/mL, 80 ng/mL; n=9) concentrations. The correlation between the expression of these markers in freshly isolated blood cells and serum levels of calcidiol was also explored (n=10). Cholecalciferol at 10−7M increased the proportion of CD4+ CD38+ and CD8+ CD38+ cells, and decreased CD8+HLA-DR+ cells. As co-expression, it increased the CD38+HLA-DR− and decreased CD38−HLA-DR+ subpopulations in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and decreased CD4+CD38−HLA-DR− and CD8+ CD38+HLA-DR+; whereas both calcidiol concentrations decreased the proliferation of CD38−HLA-DR− and CD38−HLA-DR+ subpopulations. Both forms of VitD increased the number of CD38 molecules per cell. In contrast, there was a positive but non-significant correlation between serum calcidiol levels and the expression of CD38 and HLA-DR in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Although no significant correlations were observed in vivo in healthy subjects, VitD treatment in vitro modulated immune activation by increasing the expression of CD38 and decreasing the proliferation of HLA-DR+ and resting cells, which may correlate with improved effector and decreased proliferative capabilities. These results highlight the potential use of VitD as therapeutic strategy in immune disorders.}},

abstract = {{Regulation of immune function continues to be one of the most well‐recognized extraskeletal actions of vitamin D. This stemmed initially from the discovery that antigen presenting cells such as macrophages could actively metabolize precursor 25‐hydroxyvitamin D (25D) to active 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D). Parallel observation that activated cells from the immune system expressed the intracellular vitamin D receptor (VDR) for 1,25D suggested a potential role for vitamin D as a localized endogenous modulator of immune function. Subsequent studies have expanded our understanding of how vitamin D exerts effects on both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. At an innate level, intracrine synthesis of 1,25D by macrophages and dendritic cells stimulates expression of antimicrobial proteins such as cathelicidin, as well as lowering intracellular iron concentrations via suppression of hepcidin. By potently enhancing autophagy, 1,25D may also play an important role in combatting intracellular pathogens such as M. tuberculosis and viral infections. Local synthesis of 1,25D by macrophages and dendritic cells also appears to play a pivotal role in mediating T‐cell responses to vitamin D, leading to suppression of inflammatory T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells, and concomitant induction of immunotolerogenic T‐regulatory responses. The aim of this review is to provide an update on our current understanding of these prominent immune actions of vitamin D, as well as highlighting new, less well‐recognized immune effects of vitamin D. The review also aims to place this mechanistic basis for the link between vitamin D and immunity with studies in vivo that have explored a role for vitamin D supplementation as a strategy for improved immune health. This has gained prominence in recent months with the global coronavirus disease 2019 health crisis and highlights important new objectives for future studies of vitamin D and immune function. © 2020 The Authors.

Innate immune cells produce hormonal calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, 1,25D) locally from circulating calcifediol in response to pathogen threat and an immune-specific cytokine network. Calcitriol regulates gene expression through its binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a ligand-regulated transcription factor. The hormone-bound VDR induces the transcription of genes integral to innate immunity including pattern recognition receptors, cytokines, and most importantly antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Transcription of the human AMP genes β-defensin 2/defensin-β4 (HBD2/DEFB4) and cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) is stimulated by the VDR bound to promoter-proximal vitamin D response elements. HDB2/DEFB4 and the active form of CAMP, the peptide LL-37, which form amphipathic secondary structures, were initially characterized for their antibacterial actively. Notably, calcitriol signaling induces secretion of antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo, and low circulating levels of calcifediol are associated with diverse indications characterized by impaired antibacterial immunity such as dental caries and urinary tract infections. However, recent work has also provided evidence that the same AMPs are components of 1,25D-induced antiviral responses, including those against the etiological agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus. This review surveys the evidence for 1,25D-induced antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo in humans and presents our current understanding of the potential mechanisms by which CAMP and HBD2/DEFB4 contribute to antiviral immunity.}},

Vitamin D synthesis is initiated following skin exposure to sunlight, however nutritional supplementation can be required to address deficiency, for example during the winter months or due to cultural constraints. We recently reported that 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) treatment induced alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) expression in CD4+, but not CD8+ T cells, with evidence supporting an immunoregulatory role. Research Question: To understand the relationship between vitamin D, lung AAT levels and T lymphocytes further we investigated whether TGF-β is required as a co-factor for 1,25(OH)2D3-induced upregulation of AAT by vitamin D in CD8+ T cells in vitro and correlated circulating vitamin D levels with lung AAT levels in vivo. Results: 1,25(OH)2D3 in combination with TGF-β1 increased AAT expression by CD8+ T cells, as well as VDR and RXRα gene expression, which may partly explain the requirement for TGF-β. CD4+ T cells may also require autocrine stimulation with TGF-β as a co-factor since 1,25(OH)2D3 was associated with increased TGF-β bioactivity and neutralisation of TGF-β partially abrogated 1,25(OH)2D3-induced SERPINA1 gene expression. Neither CD4+ nor CD8+ T cells responded to the circulating vitamin D precursor, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 for induction of SERPINA1, suggesting that local generation of 1,25(OH)2D3 is required. Transcriptional gene profiling studies previously demonstrated that human bronchial epithelial cells rapidly increased TGF-β2 gene expression in response to 1,25(OH)2D3. Here, human epithelial cells responded to precursor 25(OH)D3 to increase bioactive TGF-β synthesis. CD8+ T cells responded comparably to TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 to increase 1,25(OH)2D3-induced AAT. However, CD8+ T cells from adults with AAT-deficiency, homozygous for the Z allele of SERPINA1, were unable to mount this response. AAT levels in the airways of children with asthma and controls correlated with circulating 25(OH)D3. Conclusions: Vitamin D increases AAT expression in human T cells and this response is impaired in T cells from individuals homozygous for the Z allele of SERPINA1 in a clinic population. Furthermore, a correlation between circulating vitamin D and airway AAT is reported. We propose that vitamin D-induced AAT contributes to local immunomodulation and airway health effects previously attributed to vitamin D.}},

Cells of the immune and cardiovascular systems and lungs can express the vitamin D receptor, and overall these cells respond in a coherent fashion when exposed to 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D, the main metabolite of the VDES. Supplementation of vitamin D‐deficient subjects may decrease the risk of upper respiratory infections. The VDES also has broad anti‐inflammatory and anti‐thrombotic effects, and other mechanisms argue for a potential beneficial effect of a good vitamin D status on acute respiratory distress syndrome, a major complication of this SARS‐2/COVID‐19 infection. Activation of the VDES may thus have beneficial effects on the severity of COVID‐19. Meta‐analysis of observational data show that a better vitamin D status decreased the requirement of intensive care treatment or decreased mortality. A pilot study in Cordoba indicated that admission to intensive care was drastically reduced by administration of a high dose of calcifediol early after hospital admission for COVID‐19. A large observational study in Barcelona confirmed that such therapy significantly decreased the odds ratio (OR) of mortality (OR = 0.52). This was also the conclusion of a retrospective study in five hospitals of Southern Spain. A retrospective study on all Andalusian patients hospitalized because of COVID‐19, based on real‐world data from the health care system, concluded that prescription of calcifediol (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.67) or vitamin D (HR = 0.75), 15 days before hospital admission decreased mortality within the first month. In conclusion, a good vitamin D status may have beneficial effects on the course of COVID‐19.

COVID-19 is characterized by significant immune dysfunction, which is caused by strong but unregulated innate immunity with depressed adaptive immunity. Reduced and delayed responses to interferons (IFN-I/IFN-III) can increase the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and extensive immune cell infiltration into the airways, leading to pulmonary disease. The development of effective treatments for severe COVID-19 patients relies on our knowledge of the pathophysiological components of this imbalanced innate immune response. Strategies to address innate response factors will be essential. Significant efforts are currently underway to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 vaccines, such as inactivated DNA, mRNA, and protein subunit vaccines, have already been applied in clinical use. Various vaccines display different levels of effectiveness, and it is important to continue to optimize and update their composition in order to increase their effectiveness. However, due to the continuous emergence of variant viruses, improving the immunity of the general public may also increase the effectiveness of the vaccines. Many observational studies have demonstrated that serum levels of vitamin D are inversely correlated with the incidence or severity of COVID-19. Extensive evidence has shown that vitamin D supplementation could be vital in mitigating the progression of COVID-19 to reduce its severity. Vitamin D defends against SARS-CoV-2 through a complex mechanism through interactions between the modulation of innate and adaptive immune reactions, ACE2 expression, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). However, it remains unclear whether Vit-D also plays an important role in the effectiveness of different COVID-19 vaccines. Based on analysis of the molecular mechanism involved, we speculated that vit-D, via various immune signaling pathways, plays a complementary role in the development of vaccine efficacy.}},

In this regard, it has been proposed that immunomodulatory compounds capable of modulating immune activation, such as Vitamin D (VitD) may reduce HIV-1 transmission and might be used as a safe and cost-effective strategy for prevention. Considering this, we examined the in vitro effect of the treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with the active form of VitD, calcitriol, on cellular activation, function and susceptibility of CD4+ T cells to HIV-1 infection. We treated PBMCs from healthy HIV unexposed individuals (Co-HC) and frequently exposed, HIV-1 seronegative individuals (HESNs) from Colombia and from healthy non-exposed individuals from Canada (Ca-HC) with calcitriol and performed in vitro HIV-1 infection assays using X4- and R5-tropic HIV-1 strains respectively. In addition, we evaluated the activation and function of T cells and the expression of viral co-receptors, and select antiviral genes following calcitriol treatment. Calcitriol reduced the frequency of infected CD4+ T cells and the number of viral particles per cell, for both, X4- and R5-tropic viruses tested in the Co-HC and the Ca-HC, respectively, but not in HESNs. Furthermore, in the Co-HC, calcitriol reduced the frequency of polyclonally activated T cells expressing the activation markers HLA-DR and CD38, and those HLA-DR+CD38-, whereas increased the subpopulation HLA-DR-CD38+. Calcitriol treatment also decreased production of granzyme, IL-2 and MIP-1β by T cells and increased the transcriptional expression of the inhibitor of NF-kB and the antiviral genes cathelicidin (CAMP) and APOBEC3G in PBMCs from Co-HC. Our in vitro findings suggest that VitD treatment could reduce HIV-1 transmission through a specific modulation of the activation levels and function of T cells, and the production of antiviral factors. In conclusion, VitD remains as an interesting potential strategy to prevent HIV-1 transmission that should be further explored.}},

Systematic literature search was performed to identify retrospective cohort as well as clinical studies on COVID-19 mortality rates versus D3 blood levels. Mortality rates from clinical studies were corrected for age, sex and diabetes. Data were analyzed using correlation and linear regression. One population study and seven clinical studies were identified, which reported D3 blood levels pre-infection or on the day of hospital admission. They independently showed a negative Pearson correlation of D3 levels and mortality risk (r(17)=-.4154, p=.0770/r(13)=-.4886, p=.0646). For the combined data, median (IQR) D3 levels were 23.2 ng/ml (17.4 – 26.8), and a significant Pearson correlation was observed (r(32)=-.3989, p=.0194). Regression suggested a theoretical point of zero mortality at approximately 50 ng/ml D3. The two datasets provide strong evidence that low D3 is a predictor rather than a side effect of the infection. Despite ongoing vaccinations, we recommend raising serum 25(OH)D levels to above 50 ng/ml to prevent or mitigate new outbreaks due to escape mutations or decreasing antibody activity.

However, the postoperative immunosuppression provides a window for cancer cell proliferation and awakening dormant cancer cells, leading to rapid recurrences or metastases. This immunosuppressive status after surgery is associated with the severity of surgical trauma since immunosuppression induced by minimally invasive surgery is less than that of an extensive open surgery. The systemic response to tissue damages caused by surgical operations and the subsequent wound healing induced a cascade alteration in cellular immunity. After surgery, patients have a high level of circulating damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), triggering a local and systemic inflammation. The inflammatory metrics in the immediate postoperative period was associated with the prognosis of cancer patients. Neutrophils provide the first response to surgical trauma, and the production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) promotes cancer progression. Activated macrophage during wound healing presents a tumor‐associated phenotype that cancers can exploit for their survival advantage. In addition, the amplification and activation of myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) or the elevated programmed death ligand‐1 and vascular endothelial growth factor expression under surgical trauma, exacerbate the immunosuppression and favor of the formation of the premetastatic niche. Therapeutic strategies to reduce the cellular immunity impairment after surgery include anti‐DAMPs, anti‐postoperative inflammation or inflammatory/pyroptosis signal, combined immunotherapy with surgery, antiangiogenesis and targeted therapies for neutrophils, macrophages, MDSCs, and Tregs. Further, the application of enhanced recovery after surgery also has a feasible outcome for postoperative immunity restoration. Overall, current therapies to improve the cellular immunity under the special condition after surgery are relatively lacking. Further understanding the underlying mechanisms of surgical trauma‐related immunity dysfunction, phenotyping the immunosuppressive cells, and developing the related therapeutic intervention should be explored.}},

Not only are such deficiencies common, and probably the rule, vitamin D deficiency is implicated in most of the diseases of civilization. Vitamin D's final metabolic product is a potent, pleiotropic, repair and maintenance, seco-steroid hormone that targets more than 200 human genes in a wide variety of tissues, meaning it has as many mechanisms of action as genes it targets. One of the most important genes vitamin D up-regulates is for cathelicidin, a naturally occurring broad-spectrum antibiotic. Natural vitamin D levels, those found in humans living in a sun-rich environment, are between 40-70 ng per ml, levels obtained by few modern humans. Assessing serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) is the only way to make the diagnosis and to assure treatment is adequate and safe. Three treatment modalities exist for vitamin D deficiency: sunlight, artificial ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, and vitamin D3 supplementation. Treatment of vitamin D deficiency in otherwise healthy patients with 2,000-7,000 IU vitamin D per day should be sufficient to maintain year-round 25(OH)D levels between 40-70 ng per mL. In those with serious illnesses associated with vitamin D deficiency, such as cancer, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, autism, and a host of other illnesses, doses should be sufficient to maintain year-round 25(OH)D levels between 55 -70 ng per mL. Vitamin D-deficient patients with serious illness should not only be supplemented more aggressively than the well, they should have more frequent monitoring of serum 25(OH)D and serum calcium. Vitamin D should always be adjuvant treatment in patients with serious illnesses and never replace standard treatment. Theoretically, pharmacological doses of vitamin D (2,000 IU per kg per day for three days) may produce enough of the naturally occurring antibiotic cathelicidin to cure common viral respiratory infections, such as influenza and the common cold, but such a theory awaits further science.}},

There is a paucity of similar data in young individuals. Objective To study the effect of cholecalciferol and calcium supplementation on muscle strength and energy metabolism in young individuals. Subjects Forty healthy volunteers (24M/16F, mean age (SD) 31·5 ± 5·0 year) with hypovitaminosis D were randomized to either oral cholecalciferol (60 000 IU D3/week for 8 weeks followed by 60 000 IU/month for 4 months) with 1 g of elemental calcium daily or dual placebos for 6 months. Measurements Handgrip and gastro‐soleus dynamometry, pinch‐grip strength, respiratory pressures, 6‐min walk‐test and muscle energy metabolism on 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy were assessed at baseline and after 6 months. Results The mean serum 25(OH)D in the supplemented and placebo groups at baseline, two and 6 months were 25·4 ± 9·9, 94·5 ± 53·8 and 56·0 ± 17·0 nm, and 21·1 ± 9·4, 32·8 ± 14·4 and 29·7 ± 15·0 nm, respectively. The supplemented group gained a handgrip strength of 2·4 kg (95\% C.I. = 1·2–3·6); gastro‐soleus strength of 3·0 Nm (95\% C.I. = 0·1–5·9) and walking distance of 15·9 m (95\% C.I. = 6·3–25·5) over the placebo group after adjustment for age, gender and respective baseline parameters. Muscle energy parameters were comparable at 6 months. Conclusions Six months of cholecalciferol and calcium supplementation results in enhanced skeletal muscle strength and physical performance despite no change in muscle energy parameters. Cholecalciferol supplementation of 60 000 IU per month could not maintain 25(OH)D levels in the sufficient range.}},

abstract = {{Early in the twentieth century more than 80 percent of children in industrialized Europe and North America were ravaged by the devastating skeletal consequences of rickets. Finding that exposure to ultraviolet radiation or sunlight treated and prevented rickets led to the ultraviolet irradiation of foods including milk. These practices along with the fortification of a variety of foods including dairy products with vitamin D and widespread use of cod liver oil eradicated rickets as a significant health problem by the late 1930s. Many countries mandated the fortification of milk with vitamin D to prevent rickets during wartime shortages. In the 1950s, in Europe, many countries forbid fortification of dairy and food products except breakfast cereals and margarine because of an outbreak of vitamin D intoxication in neonates. Vitamin D deficiency has again become a major public health interest with its association with osteoporosis, osteomalacia, fractures, and more recently with prevention of cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other chronic illnesses. Regular sun exposure has decreased due to changing lifestyles. Vitamin D deficiency is especially prevalent in dark skinned children and adults living in Northern latitudes, and obese children and adults. Improving the vitamin D status worldwide would have dramatic effects on public health, and reduce healthcare costs for many chronic diseases. The most cost-effective way to remedy this deficiency is to increase food fortification with higher levels of vitamin D along with sensible sun exposure, and adequate vitamin D supplementation. I review the pathophysiology of vitamin D deficiency and its health consequences and provide recommendations for a new policy approach to this vital public health issue.}},

Since the UV action spectra for DNA damage, skin cancer and Vitamin D3 (vit D) photosynthesis are identical and vit D is readily available from oral supplements, why has sun protection become controversial, now that some data suggest conventionally “sufficient” levels of vit D may be less than optimal for at least some population groups? First, the media and apparently some researchers are hungry for a new message. Nevertheless, after 50 years, UV exposure is still a major avoidable health hazard. Second, the controversy is fueled by a powerful special interest group: the indoor tanning industry. They target not the frail elderly or inner-city ethnic minorities, groups for whom evidence of vit D insufficiency is strongest, but rather fair-skinned teenagers and young adults, those at highest risk of UV photodamage. Third, evolution does not keep pace with civilization. When nature gave man the appealing capacity for vit D photosynthesis, the expected lifespan was far less than 40 years. Long-term photodamage was not a concern, and vit D was not available at the corner store.

Our previous work revealed that the genomic vitamin D receptor (VDR) is already converted into a non‐genomic signaling pathway by forming a complex with p53 in the AD brain. Here, we extend our previous work to assess whether it is beneficial to supplement AD mice and humans with vitamin D. Intriguingly, we first observed that APP/PS1 mice fed a vitamin D‐sufficient diet showed significantly lower levels of serum vitamin D, suggesting its deficiency may be a consequence not a cause of AD. Moreover, supplementation of vitamin D led to increased Aβ deposition and exacerbated AD. Mechanistically, vitamin D supplementation did not rescue the genomic VDR/RXR complex but instead enhanced the non‐genomic VDR/p53 complex in AD brains. Consistently, our population‐based longitudinal study also showed that dementia‐free older adults (n = 14,648) taking vitamin D3 supplements for over 146 days/year were 1.8 times more likely to develop dementia than those not taking the supplements. Among those with pre‐existing dementia (n = 980), those taking vitamin D3 supplements for over 146 days/year had 2.17 times the risk of mortality than those not taking the supplements. Collectively, these animal model and human cohort studies caution against prolonged use of vitamin D by AD patients. We studied whether it is beneficial to supplement vitamin D to APP/PS1 mice and humans. The animal studies show vitamin D deficiency is an early disease outcome and supplementation of vitamin D worsens AD brain pathology via enhancing VDR/p53 complex to impair autophagosome. Nationwide longitudinal cohort studies also suggest long‐term vitamin D supplementation is associated with higher risk of dementia in dementia‐free older adults and higher mortality in dementia individuals. Our results caution against prolonged use of vitamin D by AD patients and older adults.}},

Webb and Engelsen recently commented that the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum used to establish Holick's rule is unknown. They consequently used a spring midday Boston solar spectrum to estimate ample sunlight exposures for previtamin D3 (preD3) at various locations. Literature review found the source upon which this rule is based was a fluorescent sunlamp (FS lamp). The FS spectrum is known and its relative weighting against the action spectra for erythema and the preD3 is significantly different from the solar spectrum used to derive the standard vitamin D effective dose (SDD). The preD3 effectiveness of the solar spectrum per unit erythemal hazard is greater than the FS lamp by a factor of 1.32. Consequently, UV exposure estimates based on Boston reference sunlight, instead of the UV lamp employed in the originating experiments, over estimate UV exposure equivalent to ∼1000 IU orally by ∼1/3. This redefinition of SDD impacts risk/benefit assessments of optimal/feasible sun exposure for vitamin D maintenance and the application of Holick's rule to rational public health messages.}},

Numerous epidemiologic studies suggest that exposure to sunlight, which enhances the production of vitamin D3 in the skin, is important in preventing many chronic diseases. Because very few foods naturally contain vitamin D, sunlight supplies most of our vitamin D requirement. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is the metabolite that should be measured in the blood to determine vitamin D status. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in infants who are solely breastfed and who do not receive vitamin D supplementation and in adults of all ages who have increased skin pigmentation or who always wear sun protection or limit their outdoor activities. Vitamin D deficiency is often misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia. A new dietary source of vitamin D is orange juice fortified with vitamin D. Studies in both human and animal models add strength to the hypothesis that the unrecognized epidemic of vitamin D deficiency worldwide is a contributing factor of many chronic debilitating diseases. Greater awareness of the insidious consequences of vitamin D deficiency is needed. Annual measurement of serum 25(OH)D is a reasonable approach to monitoring for vitamin D deficiency. The recommended adequate intakes for vitamin D are inadequate, and, in the absence of exposure to sunlight, a minimum of 1000 IU vitamin D/d is required to maintain a healthy concentration of 25(OH)D in the blood.}},

DBP also binds fatty acids and actin monomers, preventing their polymerization that could be detrimental in the circulatory system. DBP may have immune functions independent of its role as a transporter of vitamin D. Because of the abundance of DBP, many aspects of its basic biochemistry were quickly established. Other features of vitamin D action, particularly transcriptional mechanisms of regulation, received greater focus and early interest in DBP centred on its value as a tool for population genetics because of its intriguing genetic variations. Nonetheless, knowledge of DBP mechanisms in physiology was obtained, and functions beyond vitamin D ligand binding were identified. With the recent increased attention regarding the benefits of vitamin D (bone health and immunological regulation), there has been a resurgence of interest in DBP. Because DBP is the primary transporter of vitamin D, it has a role in maintaining the total levels of vitamin D for the organism and in regulating the amounts of free (unbound) vitamin D available for specific tissues and cell types to utilize. This review will describe the findings on the basic biochemistry and molecular biology of DBP, the studies that elucidated its biological functions and highlight these results in light of the current renewed interest in vitamin D and human health, as well as the debate over what constitutes sufficient levels of vitamin D.

abstract = {{Vitamin D plays an essential role in regulating calcium and phosphate metabolism and maintaining a healthy mineralized skeleton. Humans obtain vitamin D from sunlight exposure, dietary foods and supplements. There are two forms of vitamin D: vitamin D3 and vitamin D2. Vitamin D3 is synthesized endogenously in the skin and found naturally in oily fish and cod liver oil. Vitamin D2 is synthesized from ergosterol and found in yeast and mushrooms. Once vitamin D enters the circulation it is converted by 25-hydroxylase in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], which is further converted by the 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1α-hydroxylase in the kidneys to the active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D]. 1,25(OH)2D binds to its nuclear vitamin D receptor to exert its physiologic functions. These functions include: promotion of intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption, renal tubular calcium reabsorption, and calcium mobilization from bone. The Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guideline defines vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency, and sufficiency as serum concentrations of 25(OH)D of <20 ng/mL, 21–29 ng/mL, and 30–100 ng/mL, respectively. Vitamin D deficiency is a major global public health problem in all age groups. It is estimated that 1 billion people worldwide have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. This pandemic of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency is attributed to a modern lifestyle and environmental factors that restrict sunlight exposure, which is essential for endogenous synthesis of vitamin D in the skin. Vitamin D deficiency is the most common cause of rickets and osteomalacia, and can exacerbate osteoporosis. It is also associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain, muscle weakness, and an increased risk of falling. In addition, several observational studies observed the association between robust levels of serum 25(OH)D in the range of 40–60 ng/mL with decreased mortality and risk of development of several types of chronic diseases. Therefore, vitamin D-deficient patients should be treated with vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 supplementation to achieve an optimal level of serum 25(OH)D. Screening of vitamin D deficiency by measuring serum 25(OH)D is recommended in individuals at risk such as patients with diseases affecting vitamin D metabolism and absorption, osteoporosis, and older adults with a history of falls or nontraumatic fracture. It is important to know if a laboratory assay measures total 25(OH)D or only 25(OH)D3. Using assays that measure only 25(OH)D3 could underestimate total levels of 25(OH)D and may mislead physicians who treat patients with vitamin D2 supplementation.}},

Consensus was achieved after formal presentations and open discussions among experts. As will be detailed in this article, consensus was achieved with regard to the following: the importance and prevalence of nutritional rickets, amounts of vitamin D that are typically generated by sun exposure, worldwide prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, the importance of circulating concentrations of 25OHD as the best index of vitamin D stores, definitions and thresholds of vitamin D deficiency, and efficacy of vitamin D analogues in the treatment of psoriasis. Areas of uncertainly and controversy include the following: daily doses of vitamin D needed to maintain a normal level of 25OHD in the general population, recommendations for supplementation in patients with metabolic bone diseases, cutaneous production of vitamin D by UVB exposure, hepatic regulation of 25OHD metabolites, definition of vitamin D excess, vitamin D deficiency in acute illness, vitamin D requirements during reproduction, potential for a broad spectrum of cellular and organ activities under the influence of the vitamin D receptor, and potential links between vitamin D and major human diseases.

The reported study was designed with eligible consecutively recruited patients with T2DM on standard metformin therapy (n=130), randomized in 1:1 ratio, considered to have undergone Vitamin D supplementation according to the guidelines proposed by the Endocrine Society, or to have continued with metformin only. The potential benefit was monitored through the influence on glycemia level, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin resistance index (calculated as homeostatic model assessment; HOMA-IR), Castelli Risk Index I and Tryglicerides/Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TG/TBARS) Index in a 6-month follow up period.

The effect of vitamin D on HOMA-IR index, malondialdehyde levels and TG/TBARS index was not statistically significant. Further investigation should consider defining the doses of vitamin D in patients with T2DM which may attenuate the oxidative stress risk, the risk of metabolic syndrome and the risk of related cardiovascular events.}},

abstract = {{Our understanding of vitamin D has improved considerably in recent years. The role of vitamin D in preventing osteoporotic fractures is now well-established. However, an important controversy has emerged in the last decade concerning the effects of the active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D) on tissues other than bone (non-classical effects). The demonstration that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is ubiquitously, expressed combined with increasing observational data supporting a relationship between the level of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D in the serum and chronic metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease and neoplasms, have led to its redefinition as a steroid hormone and the proposal of its use in preventing and/or treating those diseases. This article is an update on the different non-bone or non-classical effects of “vitamin-hormone D”, and its potential preventive or therapeutic role in certain diseases, however, this review is not exhaustive. The different modalities of substitution or supplementation proposed in France by the Groupe de Recherche et d’Information sur les Ostéoporoses (GRIO) are also summarised.}},

The demonstration that the vitamin D receptor is expressed in virtually all cells of the body and the growing body of observational data supporting a relationship of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D to chronic metabolic, cardiovascular, and neoplastic diseases have led to widespread utilization of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention and treatment of numerous disorders. In this paper, we review both the basic and clinical aspects of vitamin D in relation to nonskeletal organ systems. We begin by focusing on the molecular aspects of vitamin D, primarily by examining the structure and function of the vitamin D receptor. This is followed by a systematic review according to tissue type of the inherent biological plausibility, the strength of the observational data, and the levels of evidence that support or refute an association between vitamin D levels or supplementation and maternal/child health as well as various disease states. Although observational studies support a strong case for an association between vitamin D and musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, neoplastic, and metabolic disorders, there remains a paucity of large-scale and long-term randomized clinical trials. Thus, at this time, more studies are needed to definitively conclude that vitamin D can offer preventive and therapeutic benefits across a wide range of physiological states and chronic nonskeletal disorders.}},

abstract = {{Vitamin D supplementation can prevent and cure nutritional rickets in infants and children. Preclinical and observational data suggest that the vitamin D endocrine system has a wide spectrum of skeletal and extra-skeletal activities. There is consensus that severe vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration <30 nmol/l) should be corrected, whereas most guidelines recommend serum 25OHD concentrations of >50 nmol/l for optimal bone health in older adults. However, the causal link between vitamin D and many extra-skeletal outcomes remains unclear. The VITAL, ViDA and D2d randomized clinical trials (combined number of participants >30,000) indicated that vitamin D supplementation of vitamin D-replete adults (baseline serum 25OHD >50 nmol/l) does not prevent cancer, cardiovascular events, falls or progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Post hoc analysis has suggested some extra-skeletal benefits for individuals with vitamin D deficiency. Over 60 Mendelian randomization studies, designed to minimize bias from confounding, have evaluated the consequences of lifelong genetically lowered serum 25OHD concentrations on various outcomes and most studies have found null effects. Four Mendelian randomization studies found an increased risk of multiple sclerosis in individuals with genetically lowered serum 25OHD concentrations. In conclusion, supplementation of vitamin D-replete individuals does not provide demonstrable health benefits. This conclusion does not contradict older guidelines that severe vitamin D deficiency should be prevented or corrected. This Review highlights results from large randomized clinical trials performed during the period 2017–2020 and Mendelian randomization studies on vitamin D levels. Together, findings indicate that vitamin D supplementation alone in vitamin D-replete adults does not provide health benefits; however, vitamin D deficiency should always be corrected. Vitamin D and calcium supplementation can cure nutritional rickets and can modestly decrease the risk of major fractures in older adults with poor vitamin D status or calcium intake.Large supplementation trials recruiting vitamin D-replete adults (serum 25OHD concentration >50 nmol/l) have demonstrated no effects on the incidence of cancer, cardiovascular events or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and no benefits in terms of bone density and the risk of falls.Post-hoc analysis of large supplementation trials has suggested that supplementation of individuals with vitamin D deficiency modestly delays age-related bone loss and progression to T2DM, and improves lung function.A meta-analysis suggested that vitamin D supplementation results in a modest decrease in cancer mortality.Over 60 Mendelian randomization studies have examined causal links between genetically lower vitamin D levels and health outcomes; most studies generated null effects except four studies that demonstrated an increased risk of multiple sclerosis.In conclusion, supplementation of vitamin D-replete individuals does not generate overall health benefits; however, correction of severe vitamin D deficiency remains essential.

Among these elements, zinc and vitamins C and D stand out for having immunomodulatory functions and for playing roles in preserving physical tissue barriers. Considering the COVID-19 pandemic, nutrients that can optimize the immune system to prevent or lower the risk of severe progression and prognosis of this viral infection become relevant. Thus, the present review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the roles of zinc and vitamins C and D in the immune response to viral infections, focusing on the synergistic action of these nutrients in the maintenance of physical tissue barriers, such as the skin and mucous membranes. The evidence found in the literature shows that deficiency of one or more of these three elements compromises the immune response, making an individual more vulnerable to viral infections and to a worse disease prognosis. Thus, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the adequate intake of zinc and vitamins C and D may represent a promising pharmacological tool due to the high demand for these nutrients in the case of contact with the virus and onset of the inflammatory process. Ongoing clinical trials will help to clarify the role of these nutrients for COVID-19 management.}},

Methods: Sixty‐nine patients with vitamin D insufficiency [25‐hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) <40 nmol/L] were recruited from the Rheumatology Outpatient Department of St George's Hospital, London. In study 1, 50 patients received 300 000 IU i.m. vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol). In study 2, 19 patients received 300 000 IU oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) under observation. Biochemical response was measured at baseline, and at 12 and 24 weeks. Results: Bolus i.m. vitamin D2 or oral vitamin D3 was well tolerated. The change from baseline in serum 25(OH)D was significantly greater at 6 and 12 weeks in study 2 (p<0.0001 and <0.0001, respectively). In study 1, a modest increase in mean serum 25(OH)D at 6, 12, and 24 weeks was observed but no patients achieved a serum 25(OH)D concentration ⩾50 nmol/L. PTH remained elevated in 42\% of patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism at 12 weeks. In study 2, 100\% and 89\% of patients had serum 25(OH)D>50 nmol/L at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. All patients with elevated baseline PTH were fully suppressed at 12 weeks. No cases of hypercalcaemia were observed in either group. Conclusion: The 300 000‐IU bolus of vitamin D2 or D3 was practical, well tolerated, and safe. Vitamin D3 had greater potency than equimolar vitamin D2, with a higher, sustained serum 25(OH)D response and efficacious PTH suppression. To adequately treat vitamin D insufficiency we would recommend administering 300 000 IU oral vitamin D3 approximately three times per year.}},

Epidemiologic evidence links vitamin D deficiency to autoimmune disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, depression, dementia, infectious diseases, musculoskeletal decline, and more. The Institute of Medicine published an exhaustive report in 2010 that concluded that vitamin D supplementation for indications other than musculoskeletal health was not adequately supported by evidence and that most North Americans receive sufficient vitamin D from their diet and sun exposure. These conclusions are at odds with some clinical practice guidelines; thus, we sought to summarize the best available evidence regarding the benefits of vitamin D supplementation, to examine the potential risks, and to provide practical dosing advice. The adequacy of vitamin D stores is determined by measuring the 25‐hydroxyvitamin D serum concentrations. The demarcations between deficiency (< 20 ng/ml), insufficiency (20–30 ng/ml), and optimal (30–80 ng/ml) serum concentrations are controversial. Vitamin D in doses of 800–5000 IU/day improve musculoskeletal health (e.g., reduces the rate of fractures and falls in older adults (aged ≥ 65 yrs). In patients with documented vitamin D deficiency, a cumulative dose of at least 600,000 IU administered over several weeks appears to be necessary to replenish vitamin D stores. Single large doses of 300,000–500,000 IU should be avoided. Vitamin D supplementation should not be offered routinely to other patient populations. Although results from some prospective clinical trials are promising, most have not been robustly designed and executed. The decision by young, otherwise healthy adults to take vitamin D in doses of 2000 IU/day or lower is unlikely to cause harm. For patients who are not at risk for developing vitamin D deficiency, sensible sun exposure is an inexpensive and enjoyable way to maintain vitamin D stores.}},

We examined the risk of dying from any cause in subjects who participated in randomized trials testing the impact of vitamin D supplementation (ergocalciferol [vitamin D2] or cholecalciferol [vitamin D3]) on any health condition.Methods The literature up to November 2006 was searched without language restriction using the following databases: PubMed, ISI Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library.Results We identified 18 independent randomized controlled trials, including 57 311 participants. A total of 4777 deaths from any cause occurred during a trial size–adjusted mean of 5.7 years. Daily doses of vitamin D supplements varied from 300 to 2000 IU. The trial size–adjusted mean daily vitamin D dose was 528 IU. In 9 trials, there was a 1.4- to 5.2-fold difference in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D between the intervention and control groups. The summary relative risk for mortality from any cause was 0.93 (95\% confidence interval, 0.87-0.99). There was neither indication for heterogeneity nor indication for publication biases. The summary relative risk did not change according to the addition of calcium supplements in the intervention.Conclusions Intake of ordinary doses of vitamin D supplements seems to be associated with decreases in total mortality rates. The relationship between baseline vitamin D status, dose of vitamin D supplements, and total mortality rates remains to be investigated. Population-based, placebo-controlled randomized trials with total mortality as the main end point should be organized for confirming these findings.}},

In this study we examined the combined effect of vitamin D supplementation and body weight on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin (25(OH)D) and serum calcium in healthy volunteers. We analyzed 22,214 recordings of vitamin D supplement use and serum 25(OH)D from 17,614 healthy adult volunteers participating in a preventive health program. This program encourages the use of vitamin D supplementation and monitors its use and serum 25(OH)D and serum calcium levels. Participants reported vitamin D supplementation ranging from 0 to 55,000 IU per day and had serum 25(OH)D levels ranging from 10.1 to 394 nmol/L. The dose response relationship between vitamin D supplementation and serum 25(OH)D followed an exponential curve. On average, serum 25(OH)D increased by 12.0 nmol/L per 1,000 IU in the supplementation interval of 0 to 1,000 IU per day and by 1.1 nmol/L per 1,000 IU in the supplementation interval of 15,000 to 20,000 IU per day. BMI, relative to absolute body weight, was found to be the better determinant of 25(OH)D. Relative to normal weight subjects, obese and overweight participants had serum 25(OH)D that were on average 19.8 nmol/L and 8.0 nmol/L lower, respectively (P<0.001). We did not observe any increase in the risk for hypercalcemia with increasing vitamin D supplementation. We recommend vitamin D supplementation be 2 to 3 times higher for obese subjects and 1.5 times higher for overweight subjects relative to normal weight subjects.

Methods: We report for the first time for a broad spectrum of autoimmune diseases in 319 patients (mean age (±SD) 43.3 ± 14.6 years, 65.5\% female, 34.5\% male) safety data for high doses of orally applied vitamin D3 (treatment period: up to 3.5 years) accompanied by a strict low-calcium diet and regular daily fluid intake of at least 2.5 L. Results: Mean vitamin D3 dose was 35,291 ± 21,791 IU per day. The measurement of more than 6100 single relevant laboratory parameters showed all mean values (±SD) within the normal range for total serum calcium (2.4 ± 0.1 mmol/L), serum creatinine (0.8 ± 0.2 mg/dL), serum creatinine associated estimated GFR (92.5 ± 17.3 mL/min), serum cystatin C (0.88 ± 0.19 mg/L), serum TSH (1.8 ± 1 mIU/L), and for 24 h urinary calcium secretion (6.9 ± 3.3 mmol/24 h). We found a very weak relationship between the dosage of oral vitamin D3 and the subsequent calcium levels, both in serum and in urinary excretion over 24 h, respectively.

Recent findings The US Institute of Medicine Recommended Dietary Allowance of vitamin D is 400\&hairsp;IU per day for children younger than 1 year of age, 600\&hairsp;IU per day for children at least 1 year of age and adults up to 70 years, and 800\&hairsp;IU per day for older adults. The US Institute of Medicine concluded that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D \&lsqb;25(OH)D\&rsqb; of 20\&hairsp;ng\&sol;ml or more will cover the requirements of 97.5\&percnt; of the population. The US Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guideline suggested that 400–1000\&hairsp;IU per day may be needed for children aged less than 1 year, 600–1000\&hairsp;IU per day for children aged 1 year or more, and 1500–2000\&hairsp;IU per day for adults aged 19 years or more to maintain 25(OH)D above the optimal level of 30\&hairsp;ng\&sol;ml. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease even in a quiescent state and those with gastric bypass malabsorb vitamin D and need more vitamin D to sustain their vitamin D status. Summary Difference in the recommendations from the US Institute of Medicine and the US Endocrine Society's Practice Guideline reflects different goals and views on current evidence. Significant gaps remain in the literature, and studies of vitamin D treatment assessing changes in outcomes at different 25(OH)D levels are needed.}},

Loss-of-function variants in CYP24A1 are associated with 24-hydroxylase deficiency (24HD), characterized by hypercalcemia, nephrolithiasis, and nephrocalcinosis. We retrospectively reviewed laboratory, imaging, and clinical characteristics of patients with suspected or confirmed 24HD and patients with other vitamin D−mediated hypercalcemia disorders: sarcoidosis, lymphoma, and exogenous vitamin D toxicity (EVT). To identify features that differentiate 24HD from other vitamin D-mediated hypercalcemia disorders. Patients seen at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) from January 1, 2008, to 31 December, 2016, with the following criteria were retrospectively identified: serum calcium ≥9.6 mg/dL, parathyroid hormone <30 pg/mL, and 1,25(OH)2D3 >40 pg/mL. Patients were considered to have 24HD if they had (1) confirmed CYP24A1 gene variant or (2) 25(OH)D3:24,25(OH)2D ratio ≥50. Patients with sarcoidosis, lymphoma, and EVT were also identified. Groups were compared using the Fisher exact test (categorical variables) or the Wilcoxon rank sum test (continuous variables). We identified 9 patients with 24HD and 28 with other vitamin D−mediated disorders. Patients with 24HD were younger at symptom onset (median 14 vs 63 years; P = .001) and had positive family history (88.9\% vs 20.8\%; P < .001), nephrocalcinosis (88.9\% vs 6.3\%; P < .001), lower lumbar spine Z-scores (median −0.50 vs 1.20; P = .01), higher peak serum phosphorus (\% of peak reference range, median 107 vs 84; P = .01), and higher urinary calcium:creatinine ratios (median 0.24 vs 0.17; P = .047). Patients with 24HD had clinical and laboratory findings that differed from other vitamin D−mediated hypercalcemia disorders. 24HD should be suspected in patients with hypercalcemia who present at younger age, have positive family history, and have nephrocalcinosis.}},

abstract = {{Vitamin D deficiency can lead to musculoskeletal diseases such as rickets and osteomalacia, but vitamin D supplementation may also prevent extraskeletal diseases such as respiratory tract infections, asthma exacerbations, pregnancy complications and premature deaths. Vitamin D has a unique metabolism as it is mainly obtained through synthesis in the skin under the influence of sunlight (i.e., ultraviolet-B radiation) whereas intake by nutrition traditionally plays a relatively minor role. Dietary guidelines for vitamin D are based on a consensus that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations are used to assess vitamin D status, with the recommended target concentrations ranging from ≥25 to ≥50 nmol/L (≥10–≥20 ng/mL), corresponding to a daily vitamin D intake of 10 to 20 μg (400–800 international units). Most populations fail to meet these recommended dietary vitamin D requirements. In Europe, 25(OH)D concentrations <30 nmol/L (12 ng/mL) and <50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) are present in 13.0 and 40.4\% of the general population, respectively. This substantial gap between officially recommended dietary reference intakes for vitamin D and the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the general population requires action from health authorities. Promotion of a healthier lifestyle with more outdoor activities and optimal nutrition are definitely warranted but will not erase vitamin D deficiency and must, in the case of sunlight exposure, be well balanced with regard to potential adverse effects such as skin cancer. Intake of vitamin D supplements is limited by relatively poor adherence (in particular in individuals with low-socioeconomic status) and potential for overdosing. Systematic vitamin D food fortification is, however, an effective approach to improve vitamin D status in the general population, and this has already been introduced by countries such as the US, Canada, India, and Finland. Recent advances in our knowledge on the safety of vitamin D treatment, the dose-response relationship of vitamin D intake and 25(OH)D levels, as well as data on the effectiveness of vitamin D fortification in countries such as Finland provide a solid basis to introduce and modify vitamin D food fortification in order to improve public health with this likewise cost-effective approach.}},

In this context, the latest research has revealed clinical benefits of high dose vitamin D3 therapy in autoimmune diseases. The necessity of high doses of vitamin D3 for treatment success can be explained by the concept of an acquired form of vitamin D resistance. Its etiology is based on the one hand on polymorphisms within genes affecting the vitamin D system, causing susceptibility towards developing low vitamin D responsiveness and autoimmune diseases; on the other hand it is based on a blockade of vitamin D receptor signaling, e.g. through pathogen infections. In this paper, we review observational and mechanistic evidence for the acquired vitamin D resistance hypothesis. We particularly focus on its clinical confirmation from our experience of treating multiple sclerosis patients with the so-called Coimbra protocol, in which daily doses up to 1000 I.U. vitamin D3 per kg body weight can be administered safely. Parathyroid hormone levels in serum thereby provide the key information for finding the right dose. We argue that acquired vitamin D resistance provides a plausible pathomechanism for the development of autoimmune diseases, which could be treated using high-dose vitamin D3 therapy.}},

Ses étiologies principales sont l’hyperparathyroïdie primaire et les pathologies néoplasiques. L’étiologie iatrogène par intoxication à la vitamine D est plus rare. Présentation du cas Une femme de 76 ans d’origine finlandaise consulte aux urgences pour une douleur thoracique. Son histoire médicale est difficile à préciser en raison de la barrière de la langue et d’une confusion initiale. Elle présente d’une hypercalcémie sévère à 4,14mmol/L, une insuffisance rénale, une arythmie cardiaque compliquée secondairement d’un épisode ischémique coronaire. La clinique et la biologie orienteront vers la recherche d’une pathologie hématologique et néoplasique. Le diagnostic étiologique iatrogène sera permis par l’apport secondaire de précisions sur son histoire médicale. Elle était traitée pour une hypoparathyroïdie post-chirurgicale par dihydrotachysterol, un dérivé de la vitamine D. L’arrêt de la substitution, le traitement par hydratation et biphosphonates ont permis la correction rapide de l’hypercalcémie. Discussion L’intoxication au dihydrotachysterol est une étiologie rare d’hypercalcémie. Du fait de sa demi-vie longue, le risque d’hypercalcémie semble plus important qu’avec les autres dérivés de la vitamine D. Cette molécule, retirée du marché français en 1982, n’est pas détectée par les dosages de 25 et 1,25 OH vitamine D. Conclusion Nous rapportons ici un cas original d’intoxication au dihydrotachysterol, dont le risque d’hypercalcémie doit être connu. Le suivi médical rapproché, recommandé en cas d’hypoparathyroïdie, semble particulièrement nécessaire en cas de supplémentation par cette molécule.}},

Recent data using various biomarkers such as intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), intestinal calcium absorption, and skeletal density measurements suggest this minimum level to be 80nmol (32ng/mL). Surprisingly, the relationship between circulating vitamin D3 and its metabolic product—25(OH)D3 has not been studied. We investigated this relationship in two separate populations: the first, individuals from Hawaii who received significant sun exposure; the second, subjects from a lactation study who received up to 6400IU vitamin D3/day for 6 months.Results (1) the relationship between circulating vitamin D3 and 25(OH)D in both groups was not linear, but appeared saturable and controlled; (2) optimal nutritional vitamin D status appeared to occur when molar ratios of circulating vitamin D3 and 25(OH)D exceeded 0.3; at this point, the Vmax of the 25-hydroxylase appeared to be achieved. This was achieved when circulating 25(OH)D exceeded 100nmol.We hypothesize that as humans live today, the 25-hydroxylase operates well below its Vmax because of chronic substrate deficiency, namely vitamin D3. When humans are sun (or dietary) replete, the vitamin D endocrine system will function in a fashion as do these other steroid synthetic pathways, not limited by substrate. Thus, the relationship between circulating vitamin D and 25(OH)D may represent what “normal” vitamin D status should be.}},

Despite this intense interest, there is still disagreement on what constitutes the lower boundary of adequacy and on the Recommended Dietary Allowance. There has also been a major push to elucidate the biochemistry of vitamin D, its metabolic pathways and the mechanisms that mediate its action. Originally thought to act by altering the expression of target genes, it was realized in the mid-1980s that some of the actions of vitamin D were too rapid to be accounted for by changes at the genomic level. These rapid non-genomic actions have attracted as much interest as the genomic actions and they have spawned additional questions in an already busy field. This mini-review attempts to summarise the in vitro and in vivo work that has been conducted to characterise the rapid non-genomic actions, the mechanisms that give rise to these properties and the roles that these play in the overall action of vitamin D at the cellular level. Understanding the effects of vitamin D at the cellular level should enable the design of elegant human studies to extract the full potential of vitamin D to benefit human health.}},

We found that Pdia3 co-localized with VDR and the caveolae scaffolding protein, caveolin-1 on the surface of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. Immunoprecipitation showed that both Pdia3 and VDR interacted with caveolin-1. Pdia3 further interacted with phospholipase A2 activating protein (PLAA), whereas VDR interacted with c-Src. 1α,25(OH)2D3 changed the interactions and transport of the two receptors and rapidly activated phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and c-Src. Silencing either receptor or caveolin-1 inhibited both PLA2 and c-Src, indicating that the two receptors function interdependently. These two receptor dependent rapid responses to 1α,25(OH)2D3 regulated gene expression, proliferation and apoptosis of MC3T3-E1 cells. These data demonstrate the importance of both receptors and caveolin-1 in mediating membrane responses to 1α,25(OH)2D3 and subsequently regulating osteoblast biology.}},

The recognition of the contribution of vitamin D depletion to increased risk of osteoporosis, and most importantly the risk of hip fracture in the elderly, has increased the clinical significance of clinical laboratory testing for vitamin D status. Research has revealed that at least three genes contribute to vitamin D activity within tissues. These are the vitamin D receptor as well as two major vitamin D metabolising enzymes, CYP27B1, responsible for synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D and CYP24, responsible for catabolism of vitamin D metabolites. Current research focuses on the contribution of vitamin D metabolism to increasing vitamin D activity.

Vitamin D receptor is found in significant concentrations in the T lymphocyte and macrophage populations. However, its highest concentration is in the immature immune cells of the thymus and the mature CD‐8 T lymphocytes. The significant role of vitamin D compounds as selective immunosuppressants is illustrated by their ability to either prevent or markedly suppress animal models of autoimmune disease. Results show that 1,25‐dihy‐droxyvitamin D3 can either prevent or markedly suppress experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, type I diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease. In almost every case, the action of the vitamin D hormone requires that the animals be maintained on a normal or high calcium diet. Possible mechanisms of suppression of these autoimmune disorders by the vitamin D hormone have been presented. The vitamin D hormone stimulates transforming growth factor TGFβ‐1 and interleukin 4 (IL‐4) production, which in turn may suppress inflammatory T cell activity. In support of this, the vitamin D hormone is unable to suppress a murine model of the human disease multiple sclerosis in IL‐4‐deficient mice. The results suggest an important role for vitamin D in autoimmune disorders and provide a fertile and interesting area of research that may yield important new therapies.—DeLuca, H. F., Cantorna, M.

abstract = {{Vitamin D deficiency is a global public health problem, a pandemic that commonly affects the elderly and those with comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, respiratory disorders, recurrent infections, immune deficiency, and malignancies, as well as ethnic minorities living in temperate countries. The same groups were worst affected by COVID-19. Since vitamin D deficiency weakens the immune system, it increases the risk of infections, complications, and deaths, such as from sepsis and COVID-19. Deficiency can be remedied cost-effectively through targeted food fortification, supplementation, and/or daily safe sun exposure. Its endocrine functions are limited to mineral metabolism, musculoskeletal systems, specific cell membrane interactions, and parathyroid gland functions. Except for the rapid, endocrine, and cell membrane-based non-genomic functions, all other biological and physiological activities of vitamin D depend on the adequate intracellular synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D (calcitriol) in peripheral target cells via the genome. Calcitriol mediates autocrine (intracrine) and paracrine signalling in immune cells, which provides broader, protective immune functions crucial to overcoming infections. The synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D (calcitriol) in peripheral target cells is dependent on diffusion and endocytosis of D3 and 25(OH)D from the circulation into them, which requires maintenance of serum 25(OH)D concentration above 50 ng/mL. Therefore, in acute infections such as sepsis and respiratory infections like COVID-19, it is necessary to rapidly provide its precursors, D3 and 25(OH)D, through the circulation to generate adequate intracellular calcitriol. Immune defence is one of the crucial non-hormonal functions of vitamin D. A single oral (bolus) dose or divided upfront loading doses between 100,000 and 500,000 IU, using 50,000 IU vitamin D3 increase the serum 25(OH)D concentrations to a therapeutic level of above 50 ng/mL that lasts between two to three months. This takes three to five days to raise serum 25(OH)D. In contrast, a single oral dose of calcifediol (0.014 mg/kg body weight) can generate the needed 25(OH)D concentration within four hours. Considering both D3 and 25(OH)D enter immune cells for generating calcitriol, using the combination of D3 (medium-term) and calcifediol (immediate) is cost-effective and leads to the best clinical outcome. To maximise protection against infections, particularly to reduce COVID-19-associated complications and deaths, healthcare workers should advise patients on safe sun exposure, adequate vitamin D supplementation and balanced diets containing zinc, magnesium, and other micronutrients to support the immune system. Meanwhile, governments, the World Health Organisation, the Centers for Disease Control, and governments should consider similar recommendations to physicians and the public, change the outdated vitamin D and other micronutrient recommendations directed to their population, and organise targetted food fortification programs for the vulnerable groups. This article discusses a rational approach to maintaining a sustained serum 25(OH)D concentration above 50 ng/mL, necessary to attain a robust immune system for overcoming infections. Such would cost-effectively improve the population’s health and reduce healthcare costs. It also describes three cost-effective, straightforward protocols for achieving and sustaining therapeutic serum 25(OH)D concentrations above 50 ng/mL (>125 nmol/L) to keep the population healthy, reduce absenteeism, improve productivity, and lower healthcare costs.}},

abstract = {{Vitamin D is a steroid hormone that has long been known for its important role in regulating body levels of calcium and phosphorus, and in mineralization of bone. In addition to its endocrine effects, vitamin D has important autocrine/paracrine roles. The last step in the activation of vitamin D, the hydroxylation on carbon 1, takes place mainly in the kidney. However, extrarenal sites showing 1alpha-hydroxylase activity have been also found. The hormonally active form of vitamin D (1,25(OH)-D3 or calcitriol) mediates its biological effects by binding to the vitamin D receptor, which then translocates to the nuclei of the cell and binds to specific DNA sites to modify the expression of target genes. After activation of the receptor, the protein changes its tridimensional conformation, this change being the key process in order to exert its nuclear actions. Several steps take place in order to increase or decrease the transcription rate of a target gene. First, homodimerization of the vitamin D receptor or heterodimerization with the retinoic X receptor allows the complex to go into the nucleus and bind to the DNA. Then several proteins are recruited to the complex that either increase or decrease chromatin condensation acting then as corepresors or coactivators, respectively, and decreasing or increasing the target gene transcription. The coactivators bind several extra proteins that build a bridge to the basal transcription machinery. Therefore, little changes in the receptor’s tridimensional change elicted by the activator can lead to differences in protein recruitment and, thus, in gene transactivation. Furthermore, differences in the cellular environment can yield different responses to the same activator. This characteristic of the nuclear receptors makes them a good candidate as a valuable therapeutic target.}},

Mounting evidence from clinical studies has demonstrated an inverse relationship between circulating vitamin D levels and the blood pressure and/or plasma renin activity, but the mechanism is not understood. We show here that renin expression and plasma angiotensin II production were increased severalfold in vitamin D receptor–null (VDR-null) mice, leading to hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and increased water intake. However, the salt- and volume-sensing mechanisms that control renin synthesis are still intact in the mutant mice. In wild-type mice, inhibition of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] synthesis also led to an increase in renin expression, whereas 1,25(OH)2D3 injection led to renin suppression. We found that vitamin D regulation of renin expression was independent of calcium metabolism and that 1,25(OH)2D3 markedly suppressed renin transcription by a VDR-mediated mechanism in cell cultures. Hence, 1,25(OH)2D3 is a novel negative endocrine regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. Its apparent critical role in electrolytes, volume, and blood pressure homeostasis suggests that vitamin D analogues could help prevent or ameliorate hypertension.}},

abstract = {{The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxvitamin D(3) (1, 25(OH)(2)D(3)), is a pleiotropic hormone whose actions include the regulation of calcium homeostasis, control of bone cell differentiation and modification of immune responses. Synthesis of 1, 25(OH)(2)D(3) from the major circulating metabolite, 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) (25(OH)D(3)), is catalysed by a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzyme, 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1alpha-hydroxylase (1alpha-OHase). Although 1alpha-OHase is expressed predominantly in the kidney, extra-renal production of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) has also been demonstrated in tissues such as lymph nodes and skin. The tight regulation of 1alpha-OHase which occurs in both renal and peripheral tissues has made studies of the expression and regulation of this enzyme remarkably difficult. However, the recent cloning of mouse, rat and human cDNAs for 1alpha-OHase (CYP1alpha/Cyp1alpha) has enabled a more thorough characterization of this enzyme. In particular, analysis of the CYP1alpha gene has identified mutations causing the inherited disorder vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1, also known as pseudo-vitamin D deficiency rickets. Studies from our own group have focused on the distribution of 1alpha-OHase in both renal and extra-renal tissues. Data indicate that the enzyme is expressed throughout the nephron, suggesting discrete endocrine and paracrine/autocrine functions. Further immunohistochemical analyses have shown that the enzyme is widely distributed in extra-renal tissues, and this appears to be due to the same gene product as the kidney. Collectively, these observations have raised important new questions concerning the role of 1alpha-OHase in vitamin D signalling at a local level. The relationship between expression of protein for 1alpha-OHase and enzyme activity has yet to be fully characterized and may be dependent on membrane proteins such as megalin. Similarly, elucidation of the mechanisms involved in differential regulation of renal and extra-renal 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) production will be essential to our understanding of the tissue-specific functions of 1alpha-OHase. These and other issues are discussed in the current review.}},

The highly regulated, renal enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1α-hydroxylase contains the component CYP27B1, which completes the activation pathway to the hormonal form 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. A five-step inactivation pathway from 1α,25-(OH)2D3 to calcitroic acid is attributed to a single multifunctional CYP, CYP24A1, which is transcriptionally induced in vitamin D target cells by the action of 1α,25-(OH)2D3. On the basis of alignments and crystal structures of other CYPs, homology models of vitamin-D-related CYPs have been generated. Two human forms of rickets caused by mutations of CYP2R1 and CYP27B1, as well as mouse knockout models of CYP27A1, CYP27B1 and CYP24A1, are helping us to establish the full in vivo physiological roles of the vitamin-D-related hydroxylases.}},

Association between low levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and increased risk of developing several immune-related diseases and disorders, including psoriasis, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, sepsis, respiratory infection, and COVID-19, has been observed.

This study therefore aimed to assess the effect of this dose of vitamin D3 in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer. Patients with bone metastases treated with bisphosphonates were enrolled into this single‐arm phase 2 study. Patients received 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 and 1000 mg of calcium supplementation each day for 4 months. The effect of this treatment on palliation, bone resorption markers, calcium metabolism, and toxicity were evaluated at baseline and monthly thereafter. Forty patients were enrolled. No significant changes in bone resorption markers were seen. Despite no change in global pain scales, there was a significant reduction in the number of sites of pain. A small but statistically significant increase in serum calcium was seen, as was a significant decrease in serum parathyroid hormone. Treatment unmasked 2 cases of primary hyperparathyroidism, but was not associated with direct toxicity. Daily doses of 10,000 IU vitamin D3 for 4 months appear safe in patients without comorbid conditions causing hypersensitivity to vitamin D.

Methods: Prospective study of clinical outcomes after therapy with the recommended vitamin D repletion algorithm. Results: Of 134 adults with CF, 109 (81.3\%) were found to have 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels below the recommended 30 ng/ml. Sixty-six of these adults completed the recommended course of 400,000 IU of oral ergocalciferol over 2 months, and only five (8\%) responded with correction of their serum 25-OHD to the goal of 30 ng/ml or greater (mean change, +0.3 ng/ml; from 18.8 to 19.1 ng/ml). In the 33 adults with CF who also completed the recommended second course of 800,000 IU of ergocalciferol over 2 months, none demonstrated correction of their deficiency (mean change, −1.2 ng/ml). Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that a majority of adults with CF have serum 25-OHD levels below 30 ng/ml, and the currently recommended ergocalciferol repletion regimen often does not fully correct vitamin D deficiency and may need to be revised to include even higher dosing of ergocalciferol.

New information regarding the mechanisms governing the function of the VDR elucidates how this molecule can be so multifunctional in a cell-specific fashion.

Based on the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties of classical and novel (CYP11A1-derived) vitamin D and lumisterol hydroxymetabolites, we have proposed that they would attenuate the self-amplifying damage in lungs and other organs through mechanisms initiated by interactions with corresponding nuclear receptors. These include the VDR mediated inhibition of NFκβ, inverse agonism on RORγ and the inhibition of ROS through activation of NRF2-dependent pathways. In addition, the non-receptor mediated actions of vitamin D and related lumisterol hydroxymetabolites would include interactions with the active sites of SARS-CoV-2 transcription machinery enzymes (Mpro;main protease and RdRp;RNA dependent RNA polymerase). Furthermore, these metabolites could interfere with the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with ACE2 by interacting with ACE2 and TMPRSS2. These interactions can cause the conformational and dynamical motion changes in TMPRSS2, which would affect TMPRSS2 to prime SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Therefore, novel, CYP11A1-derived, active forms of vitamin D and lumisterol can restrain COVID-19 through both nuclear receptor-dependent and independent mechanisms, which identify them as excellent candidates for antiviral drug research and for the educated use of their precursors as nutrients or supplements in the prevention and attenuation of the COVID-19 disease.}},

abstract = {{In the last 5 years, there has been a remarkable change in our understanding of the health benefits of vitamin D. The classical actions of vitamin D as a determinant of mineral metabolism and rachitic bone disease have been expanded to include a broader role in skeletal homoeostasis and prevalent bone disorders such as osteoporosis. However, it is the nonskeletal function of vitamin D that has attracted most attention. Although pluripotent responses to vitamin D have been recognized for many years, our new perspective on nonclassical vitamin D function stems from two more recent concepts. The first is that impaired, vitamin D status is common to many populations across the globe. This has prompted studies to explore the health impact of suboptimal circulating levels of vitamin D, with association studies linking vitamin D ‘insufficiency’ to several chronic health problems including autoimmune and cardiovascular disease, hypertension and common cancers. In support of a broader role for vitamin D in human health, studies in vitro and using animal models have highlighted immunomodulatory and anticancer effects of vitamin D that appear to depend on localized activation of vitamin D. The conclusion from these reports is that many nonclassical actions of vitamin D are independent of conventional vitamin D endocrinology and are therefore more sensitive to variations in vitamin D status. The current review summarizes these developments, with specific reference to the newly identified effects of vitamin D on the immune system, but also highlights the challenges in translating these observations to clinical practice.}},

abstract = {{Studies in the past few years have highlighted many extra-skeletal functions of vitamin D. Prominent amongst these is the ability of vitamin D to stimulate antibacterial activity in a diverse array of cells types. In this Review, the author discusses our new perspective on vitamin D as an immunomodulator, and the possible effect of this role in human disease. Interaction between vitamin D and the immune system has been recognized for many years, but its relevance to normal human physiology has only become evident in the past 5 years. Studies of innate immune responses to pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis have shown that pathogen-recognition receptor-mediated activation of localized vitamin D metabolism and signaling is a key event associated with infection. Vitamin D, acting in an intracrine fashion, is able to induce expression of antibacterial proteins and enhance the environment in which they function. The net effect of these actions is to support increased bacterial killing in a variety of cell types. The efficacy of such a response is highly dependent on vitamin D status; in other words, the availability of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D for intracrine conversion to active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by the enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1α-hydroxylase. The potential importance of this mechanism as a determinant of human disease is underlined by increasing awareness of vitamin D insufficiency across the globe. This Review will explore the molecular and cellular systems associated with antibacterial responses to vitamin D in different tissues and possible consequences of such a response for the prevention and treatment of human immune disorders.

Objectives: We investigated whether administration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) to critically ill patients with sepsis would have beneficial effects on markers of innate immunity, inflammation, and kidney injury. Methods: We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, physiologic study among 67 critically ill patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Patients were randomized to receive a single dose of calcitriol (2 μg intravenously) versus placebo. The primary outcome was plasma cathelicidin protein levels assessed 24 hours after study drug administration. Secondary outcomes included leukocyte cathelicidin mRNA expression, plasma cytokine levels (IL-10, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, and IL-2), and urinary kidney injury markers. Measurements and Main Results: Patients randomized to calcitriol (n = 36) versus placebo (n = 31) had similar plasma cathelicidin protein levels at 24 hours (P = 0.16). Calcitriol-treated patients had higher cathelicidin (P = 0.04) and IL-10 (P = 0.03) mRNA expression than placebo-treated patients 24 hours after study drug administration. Plasma cytokine levels (IL-10, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, and IL-2) and urinary kidney injury markers were similar in calcitriol- versus placebo-treated patients (P > 0.05 for all comparisons). Calcitriol had no effect on clinical outcomes nor were any adverse effects observed. Conclusions: Calcitriol administration did not increase plasma cathelicidin protein levels in critically ill patients with sepsis and had mixed effects on other immunomodulatory markers. Additional phase II trials investigating the dose and timing of calcitriol as a therapeutic agent in specific sepsis phenotypes may be warranted.

abstract = {{There has been renewed interest in vitamin D since numerous recent studies have suggested that besides its well-established roles in bone metabolism and immunity, vitamin D status is inversely associated with the incidence of several diseases, e.g., cancers, cardio-vascular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. Surprisingly, there is very little data on factors that affect absorption of this fat-soluble vitamin, although it is acknowledged that dietary vitamin D could help to fight against the subdeficient vitamin D status that is common in several populations. This review describes the state of the art concerning the fate of vitamin D in the human upper gastrointestinal tract and on the factors assumed to affect its absorption efficiency. The main conclusions are: (i) ergocalciferol (vitamin D2), the form mostly used in supplements and fortified foods, is apparently absorbed with similar efficiency to cholecalciferol (vitamin D3, the main dietary form), (ii) 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), the metabolite produced in the liver, and which can be found in foods, is better absorbed than the nonhydroxy vitamin D forms cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol, (iii) the amount of fat with which vitamin D is ingested does not seem to significantly modify the bioavailability of vitamin D3, (iv) the food matrix has apparently little effect on vitamin D bioavailability, (v) sucrose polyesters (Olestra) and tetrahydrolipstatin (orlistat) probably diminish vitamin D absorption, and (vi) there is apparently no effect of aging on vitamin D absorption efficiency. We also find that there is insufficient, or even no data on the following factors suspected of affecting vitamin D bioavailability: (i) effect of type and amount of dietary fiber, (ii) effect of vitamin D status, and (iii) effect of genetic variation in proteins involved in its intestinal absorption. In conclusion, further studies are needed to improve our knowledge of factors affecting vitamin D absorption efficiency. Clinical studies with labeled vitamin D, e.g., deuterated or 13C, are needed to accurately and definitively assess the effect of various factors on its bioavailability.}},

Excess activation of the RAS leads to renal and cardiovascular disorders, such as hypertension and chronic kidney disease, and is the major risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, atherosclerosis, and renal failure. In addition, the RAS is also involved in the pathology of other tissues. Mounting epidemiological and clinical evidence has demonstrated an association of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency with increased risks of renal and cardiovascular diseases, but the molecular basis remains poorly defined. The discovery of the vitamin D hormone as an endocrine repressor of the RAS provides a potential explanation for this association. 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 downregulates the expression of renin, the rate-limiting enzyme of the renin-angiotensin cascade. Vitamin D deficiency leads to overexpression of renin and thus activation of the RAS, causing renal and cardiovascular injuries. Defects in the vitamin D receptor signaling also promote local RAS activation in other tissues leading to detrimental effects. Physiologically the vitamin D hormone may play a role in maintaining the homeostasis of the renal and cardiovascular systems via suppressing the RAS. Pharmacologically, vitamin D analogs may be used to target the RAS for disease management.}},

Sampling human subjects, who appear to be free from disease, and assessing “normal” circulating 25(OH)D levels based on a Gaussian distribution of these values is now considered to be a grossly inaccurate method of identifying the normal range. Several factors contribute to the inaccuracy of this approach, including race, lifestyle habits, sunscreen usage, age, latitude, and inappropriately low dietary intake recommendations for vitamin D. The current adult recommendations for vitamin D, 200–600 IU/d, are very inadequate when one considers that a 10–15 min whole-body exposure to peak summer sun will generate and release up to 20,000 IU vitamin D-3 into the circulation. We are now able to better identify sufficient circulating 25(OH)D levels through the use of specific biomarkers that appropriately increase or decrease with changes in 25(OH)D levels; these include intact parathyroid hormone, calcium absorption, and bone mineral density. Using these functional indicators, several studies have more accurately defined vitamin D deficiency as circulating levels of 25(OH)D ≤ 80 nmol or 32 μg/L. Recent studies reveal that current dietary recommendations for adults are not sufficient to maintain circulating 25(OH)D levels at or above this level, especially in pregnancy and lactation.}},

abstract = {{The most classical view of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) emphasizes its role as an endocrine regulator of sodium balance and blood pressure. However, it has long become clear that the RAS has pleiotropic actions that contribute to organ damage, including modulation of inflammation. Angiotensin II (Ang II) activates angiotensin type 1 receptors (AT1R) to promote an inflammatory response and organ damage. This represents the pathophysiological basis for the successful use of RAS blockers to prevent and treat kidney and heart disease. However, other RAS components could have a built-in capacity to brake proinflammatory responses. Angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R) activation can oppose AT1R actions, such as vasodilatation, but its involvement in modulation of inflammation has not been conclusively proven. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) can process Ang II to generate angiotensin-(1–7) (Ang-(1–7)), that activates the Mas receptor to exert predominantly anti-inflammatory responses depending on the context. We now review recent advances in the understanding of the interaction of the RAS with inflammation. Specific topics in which novel information became available recently include intracellular angiotensin receptors; AT1R posttranslational modifications by tissue transglutaminase (TG2) and anti-AT1R autoimmunity; RAS modulation of lymphoid vessels and T lymphocyte responses, especially of Th17 and Treg responses; interactions with toll-like receptors (TLRs), programmed necrosis, and regulation of epigenetic modulators (e.g. microRNAs and bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins). We additionally discuss an often overlooked effect of the RAS on inflammation which is the downregulation of anti-inflammatory factors such as klotho, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), SNF-related serine/threonine-protein kinase (SNRK), serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 6 catalytic subunit (Ppp6C) and n-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP). Both transcription factors, such as nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and epigenetic regulators, such as miRNAs are involved in downmodulation of anti-inflammatory responses. A detailed analysis of pathways and targets for downmodulation of anti-inflammatory responses constitutes a novel frontier in RAS research.}},

A number of different VD-related genes (VDRG) are required for the metabolic activation of VD and the subsequent induction of its target genes. They include a set of genes that encode for VD-binding protein, metabolic enzymes, and the VD receptor. In addition to its well-characterized skeletal function, the immunoregulatory activities of VD and the related polymorphisms of VDRG have been reported and linked to its therapeutic and preventive actions for the control of several viral diseases. However, in regards to their roles in the progression of viral diseases, inconsistent and, in some cases, contradictory results also exist. To resolve this discrepancy, I conducted an extensive literature search by using relevant keywords on the PubMed website. Based on the volume of hit papers related to a certain viral infection, I summarized and compared the effects of VD and VDRG polymorphism on the infection, pathogenesis, and treatment outcomes of clinically important viral diseases. They include viral hepatitis, respiratory viral infections, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and other viral diseases, which are caused by herpesviruses, dengue virus, rotavirus, and human papillomavirus. This review will provide the most current information on the nutritional and clinical utilization of VD and VDRG in the management of the key viral diseases. This information should be valuable not only to nutritionists but also to clinicians who wish to provide evidence-based recommendations on the use of VD to virally infected patients.}},

This article reviews the immunomodulatory capacity of vitamin D3 and examines the impact of vitamin D3 supplementation as a preventive or therapeutic intervention with the intent to uncover its potential therapeutic application in infectious diseases and to identify novel areas for future research. We present a review of randomized, controlled clinical studies conducted in humans which included assessment of the immune function or clinical outcome as study end points. Current data support vitamin D3 supplementation as risk-modifying intervention in tuberculosis and viral respiratory tract infection, but the optimal dosage regimen remains to be determined.

Results: In the overall group of girls, lean mass increased significantly in both treatment groups (P ≤ 0.05); bone area and total hip BMC increased in the high-dose group (P < 0.02). In premenarcheal girls, lean mass increased significantly in both treatment groups, and there were consistent trends for increments in BMD and/or BMC at several skeletal sites, reaching significance at lumbar spine BMD in the low-dose group and at the trochanter BMC in both treatment groups. There was no significant change in lean mass, BMD, or BMC in postmenarcheal girls.

abstract = {{This review focuses on the biologic importance of the vitamin D binding protein (DBP) with emphasis on its regulation of total and free vitamin D metabolite levels in various clinical conditions. Nearly all DBP is produced in the liver, where its regulation is influenced by estrogen, glucocorticoids and inflammatory cytokines but not by vitamin D itself. DBP is the most polymorphic protein known, and different DBP alleles can have substantial impact on its biologic functions. The three most common alleles—Gc1f, Gc1s, Gc2—differ in their affinity with the vitamin D metabolites and have been variably associated with a number of clinical conditions. Although DBP has a number of biologic functions independent of vitamin D, its major biologic function is that of regulating circulating free and total levels of vitamin D metabolites. 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is the best studied form of vitamin D as it provides the best measure of vitamin D status. In a normal non-pregnant individual, approximately 0.03\% of 25(OH)D is free; 85\% is bound to DBP, 15\% is bound to albumin. The free hormone hypothesis postulates that only free 25(OH)D can enter cells. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that mice lacking DBP, and therefore with essentially undetectable 25(OH)D levels, do not show signs of vitamin D deficiency unless put on a vitamin D deficient diet. Similar observations have recently been described in a family with a DBP mutation. This hypothesis also applies to other protein bound lipophilic hormones including glucocorticoids, sex steroids, and thyroid hormone. However, tissues expressing the megalin/cubilin complex, such as the kidney, have the capability of taking up 25(OH)D still bound to DBP, but most tissues rely on the free level. Attempts to calculate the free level using affinity constants generated in a normal individual along with measurement of DBP and total 25(OH)D have not accurately reflected directly measured free levels in a number of clinical conditions. In this review, we examine the impact of different clinical conditions as well as different DBP alleles on the relationship between total and free 25(OH)D, using only data in which the free 25(OH)D level was directly measured. The major conclusion is that a number of clinical conditions alter this relationship, raising the question whether measuring just total 25(OH)D might be misleading regarding the assessment of vitamin D status, and such assessment might be improved by measuring free 25(OH)D instead of or in addition to total 25(OH)D.}},

Prior to 1920, the frequency of vitamin D deficiency in the general population of industrialized cities was high. The discovery of vitamin D led to the widespread fortification of foods e.g. milk and the virtual eradication of rickets in developed nations. Vitamin D3 was first chemically synthesized in the 1930s and its metabolism to the active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and its mode of action in calcium and phosphate homeostasis were elucidated in the latter half of the 20th century. Synthetic vitamin D analogs that mimic the physiological effects of vitamin D are now used therapeutically in diseases such as bone disease, chronic kidney disease and psoriasis.

abstract = {{After Glisson’s description of rickets, it took two centuries to realize that rickets was due to the absence of antirachitic nutrients in the diet or lack exposure of the skin to ultraviolet rays. This bone disease caused by vitamin D deficiency was one of the most common diseases of children 100 years ago. This paper explores how the definition, diagnosis, and treatment of rickets shifted in the first decades of the twentieth century. Although benefits of cod liver oil as food were known as early as the seventh century, cod liver oil was only proposed as medicinal for rickets in Northern Europe at the end of the eighteenth century. The relationship between rickets and nutritional deficiency was suspected and demonstrated between 1880 and 1915, at the same time of the discovery of other vital substances (vitamins) needed to prevent beriberi, scurvy, and pellagra. Understanding that the lack of photosynthesized vitamin D or the lack of dietary vitamin D was a similar risk of rickets was an important turn in the comprehension of the disease. We look at the sequence and turn of events related to the discovery of vitamin D. Rickets has been recognized first as a disease of urban living people. Cod liver oil had been used since 1700 as a nonspecific treatment for a range of diseases. Generations of children in cities of the north of Europe had learned to hate the taste and smell of the black oily liquid and then grown up to be parents who, in turn, hated to force it down their children’s throats. Occasional papers before 1900 pointed to its efficacy for rickets, and most textbooks of the early 1900s mentioned it only as a treatment option. The discovery in the early 1900s that artificial and natural ultraviolet rays had both antirachitic activity allowed to produce antirachitic foods just by food irradiation with artificial ultraviolet irradiation. Clinical guidelines were adopted to propose exposure to sunlight or to artificial ultraviolet radiation to prevent rickets in children. By the mid-1920s, rickets was promoted as universal, at times invisible to non-experts, but present to some degree in nearly every young child regardless of race or class. It was thus used to promote the young disciplines of preventive medicine, pediatrics, and public health. Innovative advances were made in the understanding of vitamin D synthesis from 1915 to 1935. A public health campaign of the 1930s was a success to eradicate rickets, using irradiated ergosterol from yeast to enrich milk and other foods with vitamin D, ensuring that the general population was consuming sufficient vitamin D. Rickets therefore provides an excellent window into the early politics of preventive health and the promotion of targeted interventions in the world. It is also a relevant historical counterpoint for current debates over the role of risk factors (absence of light or sun) for disease (today’s so-called “lifestyle” diseases).}},

Since this time Huldschensky has reported cures by this method. During the past winter this therapeutic measure was again employed and its effect followed by means of frequent radiographs of the epiphyses of the long bones. The mercury-vapor lamp was used and exposures of the entire body were made every few days from three to twenty minutes at a distance of 120 to 75 cm. The effect in all cases was curative, as demonstrated both by clinical examination and by the appearance of calcification at the ends of the bones. Following this success with artificial rays the effect of sunlight on infantile rickets was investigated. To this end infants were exposed, under careful supervision, to the sun's rays in increasing degree. After a period of three to four weeks a similar calcification of the epiphyses was noted, as well as general improvement. This beneficial effect of the sun's rays as well as of the artificial rays was achieved although the diet was in no way altered; some of the babies were receiving, both preceding and during the treatment, dry milk of the same lot. These results lead to the conclusion that the remarkable seasonal incidence of rickets is due to the seasonal variation of sunlight; that many cases of rickets are due to defective hygiene rather than to dietary errors (although diet is also an etiologic factor in this disorder); that sunlight should be used to prevent and to cure infantile rickets; and that in metabolism studies both on animals and on man, the influence of sunlight must be noted and taken into account.}},

Objective We aimed to examine the relation between serum vitamin D3 and 25(OH)D in normal subjects after either oral administration of vitamin D3 or ultraviolet-B radiation across a broad range of inputs. Design Values for serum vitamin D3 and (OH)D3 were aggregated from 6 studies—1 acute and 5 near-steady state—at various vitamin D3 inputs. In 3 of the steady state studies, vitamin D3 had been administered for 18–26 wk in doses of 0 to 11000 IU/d; in 2 studies, subjects had received solar or ultraviolet-B irradiation. Results In the acute study, subjects receiving a single 100000-IU dose of vitamin D3 had a rise in serum cholecalciferol to a mean of 521 nmol/L at 1 d and then a fall to near-baseline values by 7–14 d. Serum 25(OH)D peaked at 103 nmol/L on day 7 and fell slowly to baseline by day 112. In the 5 steady state studies, the relation of serum 25(OH)D to serum vitamin D3 was biphasic and was well described by a combined exponential and linear function: Y = 0.433X + 87.81[1−exp (−0.468X)], with R 2 = 0.448. Conclusions At physiologic inputs, there is rapid conversion of precursor to product at low vitamin D3 concentrations and a much slower rate of conversion at higher concentrations. These data suggest that, at typical vitamin D3 inputs and serum concentrations, there is very little native cholecalciferol in the body, and 25(OH)D constitutes the bulk of vitamin D reserves. However, at supraphysiologic inputs, large quantities of vitamin D3 are stored as the native compound, presumably in body fat, and are slowly released to be converted to 25(OH)D.}},

Recent data have linked low vitamin D levels to a wide range of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease and infection. Adequate levels of vitamin D are maintained through its cutaneous photosynthesis and oral ingestion. By some estimates, one billion people worldwide have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. A number of factors influence the photosynthesis and bioavailability of vitamin D and contribute to risk of impaired vitamin D status. These factors include variation in sun exposure due to latitude, season, time of day, atmospheric components, clothing, sunscreen use and skin pigmentation, as well as age, obesity and the incidence of several chronic illnesses. This review will focus on factors that influence vitamin D status and contribute to the prevalence of low vitamin D levels.}},

Objective: Our objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of prolonged vitamin D3 intakes of 25 and 100 μg (1000 and 4000 IU)/d. Efficacy was based on the lowest serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration achieved by subjects taking vitamin D3; potential toxicity was monitored by measuring serum calcium concentrations and by calculating urinary calcium-creatinine ratios. Design: Healthy men and women (n = 61) aged 41 ± 9 y (x̄ ± SD) were randomly assigned to receive either 25 or 100 μg vitamin D3/d for 2–5 mo, starting between January and February. Serum 25(OH)D was measured by radioimmunoassay. Results: Baseline serum 25(OH)D was 40.7 ± 15.4 nmol/L (x̄ ± SD). From 3 mo on, serum 25(OH)D plateaued at 68.7 ± 16.9 nmol/L in the 25-μg/d group and at 96.4 ± 14.6 nmol/L in the 100-μg/d group. Summertime serum 25(OH)D concentrations in 25 comparable subjects not taking vitamin D3 were 46.7 ± 17.8 nmol/L. The minimum and maximum plateau serum 25(OH)D concentrations in subjects taking 25 and 100 μg vitamin D3/d were 40 and 100 nmol/L and 69 and 125 nmol/L, respectively. Serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion did not change significantly at either dosage during the study. Conclusions: The 100-μg/d dosage of vitamin D3 effectively increased 25(OH)D to high-normal concentrations in practically all adults and serum 25(OH)D remained within the physiologic range; therefore, we consider 100 μg vitamin D3/d to be a safe intake.}},

Nearly all cell types express 24-hydroxylase, the highest activity being observed in the kidney. There is increasing evidence linking the incidence and prognosis of certain cancers to low serum 25(OH)D3 levels and high expression of vitamin D 24-hydroxylase, supporting the idea that elevated CYP24A1 expression may stimulate degradation of vitamin D metabolites including 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3. The over expression of CYP24A1 in cancer cells may be a factor affecting 1,25(OH)2D3 bioavailability and anti-proliferative activity pre-clinically and clinically. The combination of 1,25(OH)2D3 with CYP24A1 inhibitors enhances 1,25(OH)2D3 mediated signaling and anti-proliferative effects and may be useful in overcoming effects of aberrant CYP24A1 expression.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled ‘Vitamin D Workshop’.}},

The first hint of the significant role of vitamin D on the immune system was made by the discovery of the presence of the vitamin D receptor on almost all cells of the immune system. In vitro, the overwhelming effect of supra-physiological doses of vitamin D on the individual components of the immune system is very clear. Despite these promising pre-clinical results, the translation of the in vitro observations to solid clinical effects has mostly failed. Nevertheless, the evidence of a link between vitamin D deficiency and adverse outcomes is overwhelming and clearly points towards avoidance of vitamin D deficiency especially in early life.}},

Serum vitamin D deficiency (25(OH) D), and therefore reduced 1,25(OH)2D3 availability, is considered a risk factor for several chronic/inflammatory or autoimmune conditions, including infectious diseases, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and especially autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD). In ARD in particular, 1,25(OH)2D3 regulates both innate and adaptive immunity, potentiating the innate response (antimicrobial activity) but reducing adaptive immunity (antigen presentation, T and B cell activities). Regarding a possible synergism between vitamin D and GCs, several studies show that 1,25(OH)2D3 has significant additive effects on dexamethasone‐mediated inhibition of human lymphocyte and monocyte proliferation. Conversely, vitamin D deficiency seems to play a role in increasing autoantibody production by B cells, and seasonal vitamin D declines may trigger flares in ARD, as recently shown. Finally, 1,25(OH)2D3 seems to reduce aromatase activity and limit the negative effects related to increased peripheral estrogen metabolism (cell proliferation, B cell overactivity).}},

Our improved understanding of these pathways has opened new avenues for therapeutically targeting TH2 cells in asthma and allergy.

Objective: We analyzed the side effects related to calcium metabolism in RCTs, specifically hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and kidney stones, in participants who were given vitamin D supplements for ≥24 wk compared with in subjects in the placebo arm. Design: The following 3 main online databases were searched: Ovid Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Software was used for the meta-analysis. Results: A total of 48 studies with 19,833 participants were identified, which reported ≥1 of the following side effects: hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, or kidney stones.

We investigated the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on the antimicrobial activity of airway surface liquid (ASL) in human subjects. Since smoking can increase the risk of respiratory infections, we also investigated the effect of smoking in the cathelicidin response to vitamin D3 in human airway epithelia in vitro. This study is a subanalysis of single-centre community-based randomised placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Participants were randomised to receive 1000 international units per day of oral vitamin D3 or identical placebo for 90 days. Blood and ASL samples were collected preintervention and postintervention. 105 participants were originally enrolled, 86 completed the trial, and due to low protein concentration in the samples, 40 participants were finally analysed. Our primary outcome was ASL antimicrobial activity. We also considered secondary outcomes including changes in serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3), 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D3, calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH). In addition, we studied the effect of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) exposure to primary human airway epithelial cell cultures on the gene expression of cathelicidin in response to vitamin D3 and expression of CYP27B1 (1-alpha hydroxylase), responsible for vitamin D3 activation. Vitamin D3 supplementation significantly increased both ASL antimicrobial activity and serum concentration of 25(OH)D3. In a subgroup analysis, we found that smokers did not increase their baseline antimicrobial activity in response to vitamin D3. Exposure to CSE on human airway epithelia decreased baseline CYP27B1 gene expression and cathelicidin response to 25(OH)D3. Vitamin D3 supplementation for 90 days increases ASL antimicrobial activity. Data from this preliminary study suggest that smoking may alter the ability of airway epithelia to activate vitamin D3 and increase the gene expression of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide.

abstract = {{Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) constitutes a highly pathogenic virus that infects lung epithelial cells to cause a wide spectrum of respiratory diseases. Our recent studies have revealed the existence of an interferon-α/β-independent, innate antiviral response against RSV that was dependent on activation of NF-κB. We demonstrated that NF-κB inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) confers potent antiviral function against RSV in an NF-κB-dependent fashion, independent of interferon-α/β. During our efforts to study this pathway, we identified HBD2 (human β-defensin-2), a soluble secreted cationic protein as an antiviral factor induced during NF-κB-dependent innate antiviral activity in human lung epithelial cells. Our results demonstrated that HBD2 is induced by TNF and RSV in an NF-κB-dependent manner. Induction of HBD2 in infected cells was mediated by the paracrine/autocrine action of TNF produced upon RSV infection. HBD2 plays a critical role during host defense, because purified HBD2 drastically inhibited RSV infection. We also show that the antiviral mechanism of HBD2 involves blocking of viral cellular entry possibly because of destabilization/disintegration of the viral envelope. The important role of HBD2 in the innate response was also evident from loss of antiviral activity of TNF upon HBD2 silencing by short interfering RNA. The in vivo physiological relevance of HBD2 in host defense was apparent from induction of murine β-defensin-4 (murine counterpart of HBD2) in lung tissues of RSV-infected mice. Thus, HBD2 functions as an antiviral molecule during NF-κB-dependent innate antiviral immunity mediated by the autocrine/paracrine action of TNF.}},

In this study, we show that 1,25(OH)2D3 is a direct regulator of antimicrobial innate immune responses. The promoters of the human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (camp) and defensin β2 (defB2) genes contain consensus vitamin D response elements that mediate 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent gene expression. 1,25(OH)2D3 induces antimicrobial peptide gene expression in isolated human keratinocytes, monocytes and neutrophils, and human cell lines, and 1,25(OH)2D3 along with LPS synergistically induce camp expression in neutrophils. Moreover, 1,25(OH)2D3 induces corresponding increases in antimicrobial proteins and secretion of antimicrobial activity against pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 1,25(OH)2D3 thus directly regulates antimicrobial peptide gene expression, revealing the potential of its analogues in treatment of opportunistic infections.}},

In the subsequent almost 100 years since, accumulating evidence has linked vitamin D deficiency to a variety of outcomes, and this has paralleled greater public interest and awareness of the health benefits of vitamin D. Supplements containing vitamin D are now widely available in both industrialized and developing countries, and many are in the form of unregulated formulations sold to the public with little guidance for safe administration. Together, this has contributed to a transition whereby a dramatic global increase in cases of vitamin D toxicity has been reported. Clinicians are now faced with the challenge of managing this condition that can present on a spectrum from asymptomatic to acute life-threatening complications. This article considers contemporary data on vitamin D toxicity, and diagnostic and management strategies relevant to clinical practice. A suplementação de produtos alimentares com vitamina D foi fundamental para a erradicação do raquitismo no início do século XX nos Estados Unidos. Nos quase 100 anos subsequentes, o acúmulo de evidências vinculou a deficiência de vitamina D a uma variedade de desfechos, e isso tem levantado grande interesse público e conscientização dos benefícios à saúde da vitamina D. Os suplementos que contêm vitamina D estão agora amplamente disponíveis tanto nos países desenvolvidos quanto naqueles em desenvolvimento, e muitos estão na forma de formulações não regulamentadas, vendidas ao público com poucas orientações para uma administração segura. Juntos, isso contribuiu para uma transição na qual um aumento global dramático nos casos de toxicidade da vitamina D tem sido relatado. Médicos agora enfrentam o desafio de tratar essa condição que pode apresentar um espectro de complicações assintomáticas a agudas, com risco de vida.

The cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D is a function of skin pigmentation and of the solar zenith angle which depends on latitude, season, and time of day. In order to mimic the natural environment of skin to sunlight exposure, we therefore measured serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in volunteers with different skin types following repeated UV irradiation. Because melanin pigment in human skin competes for and absorbs the UVB photons responsible for the photolysis of 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D3, we also studied the effect of skin pigmentation on previtamin D3 production in a human skin model by exposing type II and type V skin samples to noon sunlight in June when the solar zenith angle is most acute. Vitamin D is rare in food. Among the vitamin D-rich food, oily fish are considered to be one of the best sources. Therefore, we analyzed the vitamin D content in several commonly consumed oily and non-oily fish. The data showed that farmed salmon had a mean content of vitamin D that was ∼25\% of the mean content found in wild caught salmon from Alaska, and that vitamin D2 was found in farmed salmon, but not in wild caught salmon. The results provide useful global guidelines for obtaining sufficient vitamin D3 by cutaneous synthesis and from dietary intake to prevent vitamin D deficiency and its health consequences, ensuing illness, especially, bone fractures in the elderly.}},

Past policy of the Institute of Medicine has set the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for vitamin D at 50 μg (2000 IU)/d, defining this as “the highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risks of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population.” However, because sunshine can provide an adult with vitamin D in an amount equivalent to daily oral consumption of 250 μg (10,000 IU)/d, this is intuitively a safe dose. The incremental consumption of 1 μg (40 IU)/day of vitamin D3 raises serum 25(OH)D by ∼1 nM (0.4 ng/ml). Therefore, if sun‐deprived adults are to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations >75 nM (30 ng/ml), they will require an intake of more than the UL for vitamin D. The mechanisms that limit vitamin D safety are the capacity of circulating vitamin D–binding protein and the ability to suppress 25(OH)D‐1‐α‐hydroxylase. Vitamin D causes hypercalcemia when the “free” concentration of 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D is inappropriately high. This displacement of 1,25(OH)2D becomes excessive as plasma 25(OH)D concentrations become higher than at least 600 nM (240 ng/ml). Plasma concentrations of unmetabolized vitamin D during the first days after an acute, large dose of vitamin D can reach the micromolar range and cause acute symptoms. The clinical trial evidence shows that a prolonged intake of 250 μg (10,000 IU)/d of vitamin D3 is likely to pose no risk of adverse effects in almost all individuals in the general population; this meets the criteria for a tolerable upper intake level.}},

In contrast to most vitamins, sufficient vitamin D can be synthesized in human skin. However, its production can be markedly decreased due to factors such as clothing, sunscreens, intentional avoidance of the direct sunlight, or the high latitude of the residence. Indeed, more than one billion people worldwide are vitamin D deficient, and the deficiency is frequently undiagnosed. The chronic deficiency is not only associated with rickets/osteomalacia/osteoporosis but it is also linked to a higher risk of hypertension, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or cancer.

abstract = {{The vitamin D endocrine system plays an essential role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism, but research during the past two decades has revealed a diverse range of biological actions that include induction of cell differentiation, inhibition of cell growth, immunomodulation, and control of other hormonal systems. Vitamin D itself is a prohormone that is metabolically converted to the active metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D]. This vitamin D hormone activates its cellular receptor (vitamin D receptor or VDR), which alters the transcription rates of target genes responsible for the biological responses. This review focuses on several recent developments that extend our understanding of the complexities of vitamin D metabolism and actions: the final step in the activation of vitamin D, conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25(OH)2D in renal proximal tubules, is now known to involve facilitated uptake and intracellular delivery of the precursor to 1α-hydroxylase. Emerging evidence using mice lacking the VDR and/or 1α-hydroxylase indicates both 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent and -independent actions of the VDR as well as VDR-dependent and -independent actions of 1,25(OH)2D3. Thus the vitamin D system may involve more than a single receptor and ligand. The presence of 1α-hydroxylase in many target cells indicates autocrine/paracrine functions for 1,25(OH)2D3 in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation. This local production of 1,25(OH)2D3 is dependent on circulating precursor levels, providing a potential explanation for the association of vitamin D deficiency with various cancers and autoimmune diseases.}},

Vitamin D intoxication was produced, as indicated by hypercalcemia, by 650 nmol/day vitamin D3 and 4600 nmol/day 25-hydroxyvitamin D3; 6500 nmol/day vitamin D3 caused hypercalcemia and death.

The following changes in plasma concentrations of these metabolites occurred as the dose level of vitamin D3 was increased from 0.65 to 650 nmol/day: vitamin D3, 11.3 to 1339 ng/ml; 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 2.3 to 643 ng/ml; 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-26,23-lactone, <0.06 to 64.5 ng/ml; 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 0.56 to 73.5 ng/ml; 25,26-dihydroxyvitamin D3, <0.2 to 16.4 ng/ml; 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 80 to 51 pg/ml.

Consumption of vitamin D-supplemented food \& drugs have increased significantly in the last couple of decades due to campaign and awareness programs. Despite such wide use of artificial vitamin D supplements, serum level of 25 hydroxyvitamin D does not always reflect the amount of uptake. In contrast to the safe sunlight exposure, prolonged and disproportionate consumption of vitamin D supplements may lead to vitamin D intoxication, even without developing hypervitaminosis D. One of the reasons why vitamin D supplementation is believed to be safe is, it rarely raises serum vitamin D levels to the toxic range even after repeated intravenous ingestion of extremely high doses of synthetic vitamin D analogs. However, prolonged consumption of vitamin D supplementation may induce hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria and hyperphosphatemia, which are considered to be the initial signs of vitamin D intoxication. It is likely that calcium and phosphorus dysregulation, induced by exogenous vitamin D supplementation, may lead to tissue and organ damages, even without developing hypervitaminosis D. It is needed to be emphasized that, because of tight homeostatic control of calcium and phosphorus, when hypercalcemia and/or hyperphosphatemia is apparent following vitamin D supplementation, the process of tissue and/or organ damage might already have been started.}},
