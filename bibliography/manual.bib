abstract = {{For many years cod liver oil has been regarded as the sovereign remedy for rickets. Its claim to therapeutic virtue rests not only on many years of clinical experience but also on metabolism tests showing its beneficial effect on the retention of calcium. It may be properly regarded as one of the well established therapeutic agents and one which should be widely utilized. It seemed, therefore, worth while to investigate whether its usefulness could not be extended to the prophylactic treatment of rickets.No doubt cod liver oil has frequently been employed in individual instances in this way. As far as we know, however, no extensive test, embodying a considerable number of cases and continuous and careful observations, has been carried out. This is the task to which we set ourselves.For various reasons we decided to carry on the investigation among a negro community, and for this purpose selected}},

abstract = {{The story of rickets leading to the discovery of vitamin D is an extraordinary tale, spread over many centuries and involving some remarkable characters with much speculation and a few mysteries, before reaching an exciting climax. It would be wrong to credit a single person as discovering rickets or being the first to describe its features, for reasons that will be set out here. Yet the emergence of the term 'rickets' is as important as the discovery of vitamin D itself and the possible causes of its deficiency. It permitted identification of a hitherto ill-defined disease entity, typically occurring in infants and children. It also provided a way for deciding if features of diseases that had been described earlier in the history of medicine could be seen as the symptoms and signs of related conditions.}},
