abstract = {{Vitamin D3 has many important health benefits. Unfortunately, these benefits are not widely known among health care personnel and the general public. As a result, most of the world’s population has serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations far below optimal values. This narrative review examines the evidence for the major causes of death including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and COVID-19 with regard to sub-optimal 25(OH)D concentrations. Evidence for the beneficial effects comes from a variety of approaches including ecological and observational studies, studies of mechanisms, and Mendelian randomization studies. Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are generally considered the strongest form of evidence for pharmaceutical drugs, the study designs and the conduct of RCTs performed for vitamin D have mostly been flawed for the following reasons: they have been based on vitamin D dose rather than on baseline and achieved 25(OH)D concentrations; they have involved participants with 25(OH)D concentrations above the population mean; they have given low vitamin D doses; and they have permitted other sources of vitamin D. Thus, the strongest evidence generally comes from the other types of studies. The general finding is that optimal 25(OH)D concentrations to support health and wellbeing are above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality rate, whereas the thresholds for several other outcomes appear to range up to 40 or 50 ng/mL. The most efficient way to achieve these concentrations is through vitamin D supplementation. Although additional studies are warranted, raising serum 25(OH)D concentrations to optimal concentrations will result in a significant reduction in preventable illness and death.}},

Its claim to therapeutic virtue rests not only on many years of clinical experience but also on metabolism tests showing its beneficial effect on the retention of calcium. It may be properly regarded as one of the well established therapeutic agents and one which should be widely utilized. It seemed, therefore, worth while to investigate whether its usefulness could not be extended to the prophylactic treatment of rickets.No doubt cod liver oil has frequently been employed in individual instances in this way. As far as we know, however, no extensive test, embodying a considerable number of cases and continuous and careful observations, has been carried out. This is the task to which we set ourselves.For various reasons we decided to carry on the investigation among a negro community, and for this purpose selected}},

It would be wrong to credit a single person as discovering rickets or being the first to describe its features, for reasons that will be set out here. Yet the emergence of the term 'rickets' is as important as the discovery of vitamin D itself and the possible causes of its deficiency. It permitted identification of a hitherto ill-defined disease entity, typically occurring in infants and children. It also provided a way for deciding if features of diseases that had been described earlier in the history of medicine could be seen as the symptoms and signs of related conditions.}},

Although these reports are intended for different purposes, the disagreements concerning the nature of the available data and the resulting conclusions have caused confusion for clinicians, researchers, and the public. In this commentary, members of the Institute of Medicine committee respond to aspects of The Endocrine Society guideline that are not well supported and in need of reconsideration. These concerns focus on target serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, the definition of vitamin D deficiency, and the question of who constitutes a population at risk vs. the general population.}},

abstract = {{1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) is known to suppress NF-κB activity, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here we show that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) physically interacts with IκB kinase β (IKKβ) to block NF-κB activation. 1,25(OH)2D3 rapidly attenuates TNFα-induced p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB activity in a VDR-dependent manner. VDR overexpression inhibits IKKβ-induced NF-κB activity. GST pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that VDR physically interacts with IKKβ and that this interaction is enhanced by 1,25(OH)2D3. Protein mapping reveals that VDR-IKKβ interaction occurs between the C-terminal portions of the VDR and IKKβ proteins. Reconstitution of VDR−/− cells with the VDR C terminus restores the ability to block TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and IL-6 up-regulation. VDR-IKKβ interaction disrupts the formation of the IKK complex and, thus, abrogates IKKβ phosphorylation at Ser-177 and abolishes IKK activity to phosphorylate IκBα. Consequently, stabilization of IκBα arrests p65/p50 nuclear translocation. Together, these data define a novel mechanism whereby 1,25(OH)2D3-VDR inhibits NF-κB activation. Background: 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits NF-κB activation by an undefined mechanism. Results: Vitamin D receptor protein binds to IKKβ protein, blocking TNFα-induced IKK complex formation and NF-κB activity. Conclusion: The vitamin D receptor suppresses NF-κB activation by directly interacting with IKKβ. Significance: This is a novel mechanism whereby 1,25(OH)2D3-VDR inhibits NF-κB.}},

abstract = {{A low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level is considered as an independent risk factor for COVID-19 severity. However, the association between vitamin D status and outcomes in COVID-19 is controversial. In the present study we investigate the association between the serum 25(OH)D level, immune response, and clinical disease course in patients with COVID-19. A total of 311 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were enrolled. For patients with a vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency, the prevalence of severe COVID-19 was higher than in those with a normal 25(OH)D level (p < 0.001). The threshold of 25(OH)D level associated with mortality was 11.4 ng/mL (p = 0.003, ROC analysis). The frequency of CD3+CD4+ T helper (Th) cells was decreased in patients with 25(OH)D level ≤ 11.4 ng/mL, compared to healthy controls (HCs). There were no differences in the frequency of naive, central memory (CM), effector memory (EM), and terminally differentiated effector memory Th cells in patients with COVID-19 compared to HCs. The frequency of T-follicular helpers was decreased both in patients with 25(OH)D level > 11.4 ng/mL (p < 0.001) and 25(OH)D level ≤ 11.4 ng/mL (p = 0.003) compared to HCs. Patients with 25(OH)D level > 11.4 ng/mL had an increased frequency of Th2 CM (p = 0.010) and decreased Th17 CM (p < 0.001). While the frequency of Th2 EM was significantly increased, the frequency of Th17 EM was significantly decreased in both groups compared to HCs. Thus, 25(OH)D level is an independent risk factor for the disease severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. We demonstrate that the serum 25(OH)D level ≤ 11.4 ng/mL is associated with the stimulation of Th2 and the downregulation of Th17 cell polarization of the adaptive immunity in patients with COVID-19.}},
