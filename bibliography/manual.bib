Here, Roger Bouillon presents an overview of these guidelines, highlighting common ground and areas of discord. Vitamin D is essential for calcium and bone homeostasis. Humans are largely dependent on UVB-radiation-induced photosynthesis of vitamin D, as few foods contain vitamin D. However, the same radiation that produces vitamin D is also carcinogenic, albeit with a long lag time, and causes DNA damage. In view of the increasing life expectancy, avoiding excessive sun exposure is prudent. Several groups of people have a shortfall between their requirements for vitamin D and their combined endogenous synthesis and intake from natural foods, and therefore need vitamin D supplementation. Governments and scientific societies are regularly updating their recommendations for intake of vitamin D, especially for groups that should (infants) or prefer to (especially elderly individuals) avoid direct sunlight. An overview of such guidelines is presented in this Review. A fairly large consensus exists that all infants should receive 400 international units (IU) (10 μg) daily during their first year of life and that elderly individuals should have access to vitamin D supplementation (at recommended dosages varying from 400 IU to 800 IU daily in most governmental guidelines but at higher dosages in other guidelines). All guidelines unanimously agree that serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) <25 nmol/l (10 ng/ml) should be avoided at all ages. Children and adults who have limited sun exposure should receive vitamin D supplementation, but the recommended doses vary widely (from 200 IU to 2,000 IU daily), in line with disagreement regarding the minimal desirable serum concentration of 25OHD (which varies from 25 nmol/l to >100 nmol/l).}},

abstract = {{To assess the evidence on SARS-CoV2 infection and Covid-19 in relation to deficiency and supplementation of vitamin D, we conducted a systematic review up to April 2021. We summarised data from 38 eligible studies, which presented risk estimates for at least one endpoint, including two RCT and 27 cohort-studies: 205565 patients with information on 25OHD status and 2022 taking vitamin D supplementation with a total of 1197 admitted to the ICU or who needed invasive mechanical ventilation or intubation and hospital stay, and more than 910 Covid-19 deaths. Primary outcomes were severity and mortality and the main aim was to evaluate the association with vitamin D supplementation. Random effects models showed that supplementation was associated with a significant lower risk of both Covid-19 severe disease (SRR 0.38, 95\% CI 0.20–0.72, 6 studies) and mortality (SRR 0.35, 95\% CI 0.17–0.70, 8 studies). There were no statistically significant dose differences between studies: summary estimates with regular doses remain statistically significant, suggesting that higher doses are not necessary. For patients on vitamin D supplementation, a greater reduction in mortality risk emerged in older individuals and at higher latitudes. Regarding the quality of studies, assessed using the New Castle-Ottawa quality scale, the analysis revealed in most cases no statistically significant differences between low, medium or high quality studies. We found significant associations of vitamin D supplementation with Covid-19, encompassing risks of disease worsening and mortality, especially in seasons characterized by 25OHD deficiency and with not severe patients. Dedicated randomized clinical studies are encouraged to confirm these results.}},

Targeting the interaction between S1 and ACE2 is a practical strategy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we show encouraging results indicating that human cathelicidin LL37 can simultaneously block viral S1 and cloak ACE2. LL37 binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 with high affinity (11.2 nM) and decreases subsequent recruitment of ACE2. Owing to the RBD blockade, LL37 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirion infection, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 4.74 μg/mL. Interestingly, LL37 also binds to ACE2 with an affinity of 25.5 nM and cloaks the ligand-binding domain (LBD), thereby decreasing S1 adherence and protecting cells against pseudovirion infection in vitro. Intranasal administration of LL37 to C57 mice infected with adenovirus expressing human ACE2 either before or after pseudovirion invasion decreased lung infection. The study identified a versatile antimicrobial peptide in humans as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 attachment using dual mechanisms, thus providing a potential candidate for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention and treatment.}},

abstract = {{Vitamin D3 has many important health benefits. Unfortunately, these benefits are not widely known among health care personnel and the general public. As a result, most of the world’s population has serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations far below optimal values. This narrative review examines the evidence for the major causes of death including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and COVID-19 with regard to sub-optimal 25(OH)D concentrations. Evidence for the beneficial effects comes from a variety of approaches including ecological and observational studies, studies of mechanisms, and Mendelian randomization studies. Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are generally considered the strongest form of evidence for pharmaceutical drugs, the study designs and the conduct of RCTs performed for vitamin D have mostly been flawed for the following reasons: they have been based on vitamin D dose rather than on baseline and achieved 25(OH)D concentrations; they have involved participants with 25(OH)D concentrations above the population mean; they have given low vitamin D doses; and they have permitted other sources of vitamin D. Thus, the strongest evidence generally comes from the other types of studies. The general finding is that optimal 25(OH)D concentrations to support health and wellbeing are above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality rate, whereas the thresholds for several other outcomes appear to range up to 40 or 50 ng/mL. The most efficient way to achieve these concentrations is through vitamin D supplementation. Although additional studies are warranted, raising serum 25(OH)D concentrations to optimal concentrations will result in a significant reduction in preventable illness and death.}},

abstract = {{1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) is known to suppress NF-κB activity, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here we show that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) physically interacts with IκB kinase β (IKKβ) to block NF-κB activation. 1,25(OH)2D3 rapidly attenuates TNFα-induced p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB activity in a VDR-dependent manner. VDR overexpression inhibits IKKβ-induced NF-κB activity. GST pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that VDR physically interacts with IKKβ and that this interaction is enhanced by 1,25(OH)2D3. Protein mapping reveals that VDR-IKKβ interaction occurs between the C-terminal portions of the VDR and IKKβ proteins. Reconstitution of VDR−/− cells with the VDR C terminus restores the ability to block TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and IL-6 up-regulation. VDR-IKKβ interaction disrupts the formation of the IKK complex and, thus, abrogates IKKβ phosphorylation at Ser-177 and abolishes IKK activity to phosphorylate IκBα. Consequently, stabilization of IκBα arrests p65/p50 nuclear translocation. Together, these data define a novel mechanism whereby 1,25(OH)2D3-VDR inhibits NF-κB activation. Background: 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits NF-κB activation by an undefined mechanism. Results: Vitamin D receptor protein binds to IKKβ protein, blocking TNFα-induced IKK complex formation and NF-κB activity. Conclusion: The vitamin D receptor suppresses NF-κB activation by directly interacting with IKKβ. Significance: This is a novel mechanism whereby 1,25(OH)2D3-VDR inhibits NF-κB.}},

abstract = {{A low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level is considered as an independent risk factor for COVID-19 severity. However, the association between vitamin D status and outcomes in COVID-19 is controversial. In the present study we investigate the association between the serum 25(OH)D level, immune response, and clinical disease course in patients with COVID-19. A total of 311 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were enrolled. For patients with a vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency, the prevalence of severe COVID-19 was higher than in those with a normal 25(OH)D level (p < 0.001). The threshold of 25(OH)D level associated with mortality was 11.4 ng/mL (p = 0.003, ROC analysis). The frequency of CD3+CD4+ T helper (Th) cells was decreased in patients with 25(OH)D level ≤ 11.4 ng/mL, compared to healthy controls (HCs). There were no differences in the frequency of naive, central memory (CM), effector memory (EM), and terminally differentiated effector memory Th cells in patients with COVID-19 compared to HCs. The frequency of T-follicular helpers was decreased both in patients with 25(OH)D level > 11.4 ng/mL (p < 0.001) and 25(OH)D level ≤ 11.4 ng/mL (p = 0.003) compared to HCs. Patients with 25(OH)D level > 11.4 ng/mL had an increased frequency of Th2 CM (p = 0.010) and decreased Th17 CM (p < 0.001). While the frequency of Th2 EM was significantly increased, the frequency of Th17 EM was significantly decreased in both groups compared to HCs. Thus, 25(OH)D level is an independent risk factor for the disease severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. We demonstrate that the serum 25(OH)D level ≤ 11.4 ng/mL is associated with the stimulation of Th2 and the downregulation of Th17 cell polarization of the adaptive immunity in patients with COVID-19.}},
